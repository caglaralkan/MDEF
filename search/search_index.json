In collaboration with two colleagues from MDEF Ahmet and Korbi, we are planning to organize some workshops related with different topics, materials and mediums in order to generate some sharing chains. Potential participants \u00b6 MDEF Colleagues Connecthort Community Hort del Clot Community Public Context \u00b6 Urban practices as crafts and makers spaces, small carpenter and metal work workshops, urban farms, horticulture trials, community gardens are the weak signals of the emergent future and they need to be more accessible for the public. Current Situation \u00b6 There are thousands of videos, gifs, pictures, posts, manuals, patterns and methods on social networks and web. Beside the digital platforms it\u2019s not so common to share the experiences and knowledge in order to encourage the urban productivity and generate the sharing chain concepts. Even maker spaces and community gardens seems quite isolated. Engagement and Limits \u00b6 Connection between the communities that I am in touch with look quite strong. They are sharing the experiences and knowledge, supporting each other and collaborate if necessary. But in terms of the spaces and places they have some limitations and they don\u2019t look so well known in the public. It could be a decision made because of the conditions; community gardens would have some troubles with renewing the contracts with the municipalities that they have the right to use the place that they own. So, this kind of limitations would make them a bit isolated from the public and keep them just in the neighborhood. Theory of Change \u00b6 From my perspective urban practices and productive places should be independent from the spaces and they need to be reach public to make an impact among the societies. Additionally, for sustainability and evolving, sharing the methodology and experiences is better than teaching approach . Design Challenges and Opportunities \u00b6 Extending the limits of maker spaces and moving them to public by pop-up workshops would be a challenge. This would provide so much opportunities for both public and communities. Pop-up workshops can generate synergy and provide the urban practices more reputation. Sharing the knowledge and experiences during workshops would raise awareness on so many subjects that cities are struggling. General Reflection \u00b6 It was a hard week for me, I was quiet sick but I tried to attend the classes as much as I could. The community engagement lectures surprisingly focusing on the role of the designers in the design processes with less complicated way. Rather the lectures tried to emphasis the collective minds. On the other hand, the mapping of the process and potential collaborators should be considered in advance by designer. It reminds me the story-board of any scenarios before its going to written. Mapping of relations of fight \u00b6 Mapping of relations of potential intervantions \u00b6 The Roleplay exercise that we practiced in the class was nice to see the view points of different stakeholders involved in a gentrification process of a space which is a real case in Poblenou. It would have been even more efficient if at least two members would be from our MDEF community in addition to the already assigned personalities-personas. It would be nicer to see and hear the thoughts of real people perspectives. The lectures end up with a nice yoga and related sculpture practices of some hierarchies of today and desired emergent future models comparisons;","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20Engagement/#community-engagement","text":"","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20Engagement/#envisioning-my-intervention","text":"Personally I am interested in democratization of producing, growing, cultivating in urban areas.

How a machine is able to fill the gap between two different human faces? One of the most exciting thing that I discovered during the classes is AI is able to generate anonymous human faces and it is also able to generate hundred variations in order to make an animation like transition. And the real name of this action is generating interpolation video between seeds; With the google collab notebooks we have learnt how facial, object and item recognition work within the Agents with the different confidence percentages among images; During the classes it was helpful to discover how machines learn by classes; We started to design our Agent who is an expert on fart in the ecological base but during the process we decided to make it more simple and funny, as it would have been so complicated to deal with all the methane effects on the environment and all the other datasets that we need to design a stable and productive Agent. After discussing about the general concept of the fart Agent we decided to use CCTV video recordings as the main dataset.
