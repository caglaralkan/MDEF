But, resulted from our experiences we have some practices. Methods of Prototyping and Experimentation in RtD \u00b6 role 1 : The prototype as an experimental component; It\u2019s a very helpful method to develop a product that already exists. In industrial design we can call it redesign . It\u2019s also so common in usability labs for testing different user approaches , it\u2019s not only to test interfaces but also to develop some user friendly forms and attachments. I practiced this method on many design project for instance; a portable X-RAY machine. We tried various designs for interface and most importantly we tried alternatives by dividing the machine into parts to make it easy to use but mostly in order to make it less harmful for the operators, as they are exposed to x-rays a lot. role 4 : The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry; I think this method is more efficient to test new concepts . More or less I also experienced this method to generate a new concept for alcohol meter design. It was a station-kiosk which designed to be used by self decision to inform the driver to warn before start the engine. It was quite helpful to use first digital based prototype to see if the idea works second physical prototypes to test the usability and interactions. role 3 : The prototype as a research archetype; This method would lead some ideas and projects to creative solutions, the examples on the presentation looked really breathtaking.

And during the design process as a way of drifting, serial method looks more interesting to me because I am still not so determined about my final project and I am open for new encounters and discoveries on the path that I want to walk. Communication Methods and Mediums \u00b6 Urban productivity practices Urban farming/ Urban growing/ Maker spaces/ Productive domestic spaces/ Productive community places/ Productive public places(meeting points It isn\u2019t easy to name or specify it, but all the productive practices above needs a kind of knowledge in any case. On the other hand, the amount of knowledge or the way of sharing the necessary info to do productive practices effects the creativity and possible developments in a negative way. So, communication methods and mediums should be determined so carefully in order to have a sustainable productivity and creativity. Stop motion videos, Video journaling, Icons or drawings to make it easy to understand the topics presented, Photographing, and Infographics, would be some ways to document, to show, to explain and give ideas/inspirations/motivations/support the people that I am planning to collaborate. But communication methods and mediums can change according to the locations and number of people that I want to reach. For example; *If I start to do sth at my terrace and collaborate with the people just in my building or just with the MDEF people, a single WhatsApp group and some quick posters and short videos would help to built and support the community. *If I start with a community garden and collaborate with in a neighbourhood, then a Facebook group or an Instagram page would help me to communicate better in terms of communication and support me to reach more people. Additionally, instagram stories and posts will be better to see the progress and the documentation of my project. As the scale of the project change communication mediums and methods need to be considered and redesigned according to take more benefit. First interventions (Experiments, Pilots and first collective intervention): \u00b6 Description and results; \u00b6 Since the industrial revolution most of the people believe that production processes are so difficult and hard to deal with. The approach of most of the manufacturers is to make the consumers completely depended on them. Basically, we can see the example of this approach by the smartphone companies. Apple is almost about to become a monopoly in the smartphone industry and it doesn\u2019t want us to open the phone to see what is inside. We\u2019ve become so lazy and unconfident because black boxes made us to think they are so complicated. We become like machines just to consume, buy anything without thinking if we need them with the help of ads on everywhere. But small communities which try to collapse that bias of producing things is impossible by DIY projects nowadays. And so far from my experiences the main idea is to provide spaces for individuals in those communities. Mostly people want to feel that they have spaces in somewhere, in other words the need to feel belonging somewhere some place, some people without being judged and feel confident. Production Party Interventions: \u00b6 As a first collective intervention I collaborated with Ahmed and Korbi. They have completely different backgrounds; Ahmed is a architect and Korbi is coming from philosophy and international relationship fields. So as an industrial designer it was not easy to design a common project to work on without patronizing my teammates. Our common view point was the desire and need of personal and communal productivity and hacking the supply chain that imposed on us since the industrial revolution. That\u2019s why we decided to name our interventions \u201cproduction party\u201d. Firstly, we used to have different ideas individually about a potential intervention due to test the productivity in the urban spaces. I had the desire to work on something related to urban farming because I already contacted with three different community gardens in Barcelona. Ahmed wanted to work on fabrics and experience sawing and Korbi wanted to built a nomad furniture in order to test the recipe that he found on web. The main struggle about having different ideas and projects resulted from the comfort zone trouble. Each of us felt safer in our own comfort zone. We ended up with the idea of building a vase out of clay that we had designed on Rhinoceros by layers (which can be produced through 3D printer) and to do so, firstly Ahmed and me shared our knowledge of Rhinoceros and 3D modeling with Korbi. It was an efficient warm up exercise for us to get use to each other. None of us had the knowledge or experience on clay as a material. So, it was completely a discovery for three of us. Secondly, we decided to design an intervention by including our MDEF community. We discussed a lot on different ideas. At the end we planned to built two different items out of cardboards with two different instructions and within two groups. (We chose cardboard scraps as a main material, because it\u2019s a material quite accessible and according to me cardboard has incredible potential) It was an efficient method for me to see the difference between two recipes, processes and outcomes. As I had some knowledge on working with cardboard, I preferred to work with printed patterns of a rocking horse, while the second group tried to built a chair by drawing and following the instructions. The first two question appeared in minds while cutting the pieces were the direction and the thickness of the cardboards that needed to built the item. The process of \u201cthe production party intervention\u201d showed us how important is that to have appropriate, good and enough instructions to built something by your own especially when you don\u2019t have enough knowledge and experience on the subject. Additionally, I am quite familiar with this subject from the years that I worked in IKEA. As a retailer of self assembled furnitures, manual designs are very important topic for the company. Manuals, instructions or recipe book, however we called them would be a potential project that we can work on in order to support the concept of some DIY projects. Lastly, our last intervention happened within a workshop which was organized by CdEF -Caixa d\u2019Eines i Feines- a \u201csharing chain\u201d. It was more than a sewing workshop; they are sharing knowledge, machines, tools, materials, space, energy and care with participants-guests. We were able to share a lot in a single evening. As I have some experience and knowledge in sewing, \u0131 tried to encourage my teammates -Ahmed and Korbi- in order to use the sewing machine. It was the first time that Ahmed experienced to saw with machine. We patched some items and we were able to built a fabric shopping bag that we had tried to sew by hand before. We were able to see the difference between the processes when we gain some experience and have better instructions. As a team we also tried to encourage other participants, who came there for the first time and has few knowledge and experience on the topic like us, to involve in the process. It was another efficient experience for me. I figured out personal productivity needs some motivation and support especially when you have little knowledge and experience on the topic. At this point I think it\u2019s really necessary to provide space for individuals to feel confident within the communities like this. Experiencing or trying together by sharing knowledge rather than teaching directly, and encouraging even ends up with fail. And finally, two basic questions appeared in my mind; What discourages you to start your own DIY project? What can motivate you to start your own DIY project?","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20Studio/#vision-and-goals","text":"It\u2019s not easy to be totally aware that what kind of abilities, skills or knowledge we have.

Since the pandemic started we all started to spend more time indoor for ourselves and for our hobbies. I guess its instinctive that most of us at least tried to grow some plants and vegetables.

But, since I arrived Barcelona I have the opportunity to spend more time on this concept. I attended Laras project presentation of \u201cAlmacen de Residues\u201d and I found it really interesting in terms of making the scale up by collaborating with restaurants and community gardens. I was not able to attend the paper and soap workshop because I was so sick at that moment, but her works changed my perception to the biomaterial concept. This week we started with so much practices and we worked within the groups. Seher, Ahmed and me we tried to build some bio materials with two different recipes very first day; For the first one, we had 60 grams of coffee scrub, avocado and kiwi peels and oak leafs mixture. I guess because of the volume of coffee scrub 60 grams of food waste was a bit much for the station 4 recipe with the 45 grs. pine resin, 15 ml. alcohol and 5 grs. carnauba wax. The most amazing part of first recipe was to press the mixture with the mold. Probably that reminded me mold making and crafts processes which I worked on a lot. Secondly, we had platanus occidentalis pollens for station 3 recipe and we added them on the mixture of 12,5 grs alginate, 500ml. water and 30ml. glycerin. We forgot to add 30grs. CaCl to water which enables the preservation. We sprayed that over after putting the mixture in mold. The deliverable of the first week; Add a little bit of body text by caglaralkan S-Biotica visit \u00b6 Even if it was freezing, the visit to S-Biotica was helpful to discover more about bio-materials. Especially, we had the chance to have some hands-on experience on ##mysillyum##. We tried to recipes/methods; 1- Preparing a mixture(we used egg boxes cardboard, coffee ground, orange and lemon peels) to feed mysillyum, then sterilising that in the plastic bag by putting it in pressure cooker for 30 minutes, adding the mysillyum after cooling down a bit and by setting the sterile conditions in Bio-Lab in IAAC. 2- Making mysillyum bricks by adding a molding powder and water and putting and pressing it in a mold. Material exploration \u00b6 onion peels by Seher Krishna As a group, Seher led us to discover about biomaterials. She has some experiences on that. We deceided to work with onion peels as onion is used widely all around the world and almost every cuisine have it. As the main idea is to work with some wastes, we decided to collaborate with a restaurant called Jerusalem in Poblenou and Micampus community for onion peels and we got coffee grounds from Itnig. After searching the properties of onion peels we decided to focus on the color and light reflection. Firstly, we work on starch base recipe to make the bioplastic. But, we were not happy with the elasticity of the result and even one of the trials was a fail because of using the onion peels without processing it into the blender. The material stuck on the mold. Secondly, we worked on gelatin base recipe.

I was not able to attend the paper and soap workshop because I was so sick at that moment, but her works changed my perception to the biomaterial concept. This week we started with so much practices and we worked within the groups. Seher, Ahmed and me we tried to build some bio materials with two different recipes very first day; For the first one, we had 60 grams of coffee scrub, avocado and kiwi peels and oak leafs mixture. I guess because of the volume of coffee scrub 60 grams of food waste was a bit much for the station 4 recipe with the 45 grs. pine resin, 15 ml. alcohol and 5 grs. carnauba wax. The most amazing part of first recipe was to press the mixture with the mold. Probably that reminded me mold making and crafts processes which I worked on a lot. Secondly, we had platanus occidentalis pollens for station 3 recipe and we added them on the mixture of 12,5 grs alginate, 500ml. water and 30ml. glycerin. We forgot to add 30grs.

After searching the properties of onion peels we decided to focus on the color and light reflection. Firstly, we work on starch base recipe to make the bioplastic. But, we were not happy with the elasticity of the result and even one of the trials was a fail because of using the onion peels without processing it into the blender. The material stuck on the mold.

I am confident with the circuits, but coding language is still complicated for me. I guess it will take some time to get familiar and feel comfortable about this language. I searched and found a code to work the piezzo buzzer on ESP32 feather on arduino. I tried to figure out about the whole code, but still I am still far away to be able to design one by my own. circuit by caglaralkan Class Task No:2 \u00b6 As a second task, after the presentation about the 2D-3D modeling softwares, I decided to discover Grasshopper. I am good at using Rhineceros as a 3D modeling application, but mostly I am a bit old fashion. My knowledge based on more technical aspects. If I want to change a small thing on my design after finalizing a 3D model, I need to start to work from the beginning. So, Ahmed helped me to discover Grasshopper and now I do understand what is parametric design is in a better way. As we are planning to work on a modular indoor water-wall, it would be useful for me to design with the help of parametric design tools. discovering grasshopper by caglaralkan Class Task No:3 \u00b6 By using Rhineceros I designed a laptop-stand which stands by the idea of interlocking. As a first step, I checked the materials and their thicknesses. The material thickness is the most important factor for interlocking designs because hacks-notches are keys for the quality of the design. After discussing with Adai about the design and tolerances of the outlines, I modified my design according to fit the pieces on a single cardboard (60X100cm). I cut 2 pieces as a demo in order to test the hacks-notches to get the best results and stability of the stand. During the process I figured out how to use the laser cutter. Beyond the procedures that we have to follow, technical details as; the order of the pieces that we want to cut classified by color coding, and the datas about different materials for various thicknesses and colors hanging on the wall is quite helpful to learn about the details. On the other hand, interface of the software to use the laser cutter is quite easy and clear. Thanks to Adai and Josep again for their support. Interlocking - Cardboard Laptop Stand by caglaralkan Class Task No:4 \u00b6 Building a telegraph like device with LDR and LED with arduino was the fourth task. Even it looked like simple to work with photocell and LED an first glance, it was not possible to go further and built a code for decoding the light signals into Morse code. We started to work with Ahmed on circuit of LDR-photocell and we found the code to work, we thought that we succeed in that but after Victor joined us he remarked that there is a problem with the code because there were a lot of noise in the reading of the amount of the light. As I remember correctly we damaged one Ahmed\u2019s board because we connected the LDR to 5V pin rather than 3-3.3V and it was the main reason of that noise. Then, we continued with the LED circuit. But, we couldn\u2019t achieved with ESP32 and as Wen joined us, we tried to build the circuit with Arduino-UNO. We tried several circuits and codes but we failed. After Victor helped us we checked the items of the circuit with Multimeter and we discovered that one of the cables misbehaved! Additionally, we have learned another important thing about coding; the code is not active on an additional page and it has to be in color to work which we missed. Finally, we put the LDR and LED circuits in a box and tried to build an isolated environment to read the signals from LED when we push the bouton shortly and longer. But, the code that we found to encode and decode the readings and convert those into Morse code and letters had so much lines of problems. So, we were not able to go further in order to build a telegraph with LDR and LED. LDR circuit and Code by caglaralkan Challenge No:1 \u00b6 As a group, after discussing about our common interest and as we want to work on water bricks to store domestic grey water, we decided to work on something related to modularity, interchangeability, personalisation of a product\u2026 We ended up with the idea of building a DIY toolkit which provides designing unique tile decorations and patterns made of those. Firstly, we talked on 3D and 2D options and then we decided to focus on 2D option. For a simple tile decoration we need vinyl designs which needs to be sticked on stencil to transfer the ceramic ink. Instead of providing ready to use patterns, stickers, vinyls we preferred to work on a grid board which provides the user to make their own unique design. Tile-Deco is a concept of grid that made of acrylic and magnets and has geometric pieces which can be located on and stick by magnets to the grid in order to form various tile decorations. Through the design process of the grid board we tried to prevent from shades and reflections which ruins the quality of the photo-digitalisation process of the vinyl. But, as the acrylic thickness and magnet sizes are defined, we couldn\u2019t avoid from that. On the other hand, we covered the acrylic surfaces with a mat vinyl to prevent the reflections. At least we succeeded to get rid of the reflections to enhance the quality of the photo-digitalisation process. But, of course the transfer of the vinyl on the grid board was not easy, we were not satisfied with the first attempt and for the second one magnets destroyed the grid engraved vinyl and fortunately we satisfied with the third vinyl design. Another problem that we faced with was the unsuitability of some geometric pieces which helps to generate the tile decoration design. Some geometric items has only a single magnet on them and this cause a unstable position on the gird. (During the presentation one of the constructive critic was to make the grid board double size in order tom prevent this problem, this could be a perfect solution for the problem) The next step was making the patterns aligned with the photo-digitalisation process. As we took some tile decoration samples photos and we also worked on the various patterns options on 2D softwares. We used Illustrator and Inkscape to generate some patterns. To sum up, the grid board building process was a good experience to use the laser cutter after designing that on Rhinoceros and worked on the technical details to get the best results with the magnets we had to locate on the grid. The final result can be improved by using a thinner and mat acrylic and also by using smaller magnets. This will prevent the shades during the photo-digitalisation process and improve the quality of the edges of the tile decorations. Additionally, building it double size will provide all geometric shapes which helps to build the tile decoration completely stable on the grid. As a development plan; we can continue with 3D options but, we are not sure about how to integrate electronics on our project to develop for the next stages. Tile Deco by caglaralkan Repository link; https://github.com/paresmarc/tiledeco Class Task No:5 \u00b6 Contrary to the previous tasks, rather than modeling some basic thing on Rhinoceros I decided to download a 3D shark model which has has connected pieces in order to test the 3D printers capacity. I downloaded the file from \u201cthingiverse.com\u201d and I discovered that the file has some specifications to help-support the printing process; as if it needs support for being built\u2026 After exported the file in .stl format, I opened that in Ultimaker-Cura and slice it. Surprisingly, 3D printing process with filaments is easier than 3D printing process of clay. When we tried to print some water brick samples made of clay by 3D printing, we had to make 4-5 tests for nozzle distance and speed in order to get the best results. But, I guess as filaments are more stable material, it was fast and easy to get the results. Furthermore, I wanted to print the model by the white filament to use it efficiently during the digital 3D scanning process, but as the white filament spool was heavy, I ended up using the black filament. As I was expecting the black filament effected the process of the digital scanning in a negative way. I was not able to scan the shark with scanner. I tried to scan a asthma-spray pump. Unfortunately, there are some missing surfaces on it. I also tried to scan the bust as it is completely white and less surfaces towards the ground. The result was neither a success, nor a disaster. As long as it hasn\u2019t a complicated organic shape, I prefer to 3D model the object rather than 3D scanning. 3D Shark with joints by caglaralkan Class Task No:6 \u00b6 Networking class with Victor was an introduction for creating network by using the Arduino software and local server. We worked within teams and try to connected to Victors computer by local server and Arduino software interface (especially serial monitor) In order to connect to the Victors computer we need to change some specific parts of the code on Arduino. First of all, we needed to download PunSubClient library and we had to connect to the local network by changing the Wifi name and password on the code. Then, we also had to modify the mqttClientuser (Victor), topicToSub and mqttClientName(our team name). Actually, apart from those, Marielle changed some lines on the code but I couldn\u2019t catch those parts. On the other hand, we were able to modify the message that we sent to Victors computer ( rather than saying \u201chello!\u201d) Coding for Network by caglaralkan Class Task No:7 \u00b6 Beyond blink-breathe-burn, todays class should be named as Coding Language-101. We started the session with \u201cHow hard can it be to turn on a LED?\u201dand I can say that it would be so hard sometimes because of a misbehaved cable or disfunction LED or a wrong type of resistor. I don\u2019t know if its Oscars talent but somehow he was able to explain so many thing about the coding language. At least I was able to catch the steps during the class even some difficulties happened. Oscar tried to move us forward in terms of networking through Arduino from the point that Victor started last week. Surprisingly, this was the best organized hands on learning session of the semester. We went through several steps; just by building a basic LED circuit we started with a \u201cblink\u201d command, and we tried to connected to a network and comment on a LED through an online dashboard. Then, we discovered breathe and burn commands and some important shortcuts instead of repeating the lines in coding; (int I=0;i>5;i++) Also \u201cdefining functions\u201d and \u201cif, else if command lines in the loop\u201d are the other meaningful discoveries for me. Even I am not able to figure it out completely this line.(int num_reps=3 int delay_time=500)I feel more comfortable and ready to work on coding more. Another small but unexpected problem was even the code was correct because of so many people try to connect to the server at the same time, I was not able to connect the server. It took sometime for me to figure that out. I needed to reset the Arduino in order to connect to server and synchronize my Arduino and LED circuit with the others. Coding Language-101 by caglaralkan Class Task No:8 \u00b6 I started my CNC task by modeling a bed-side table on Rhinoceros. As I already knew the thickness of the plywood(15mm), I decided to build an interlocking bed-side table. After modeling the piece, I thought on the modifications on drawing which is necessary for the CNC cutting. As I had decided to use 6mm end-mill, I modified the inner and outer corners of the pieces accordingly. It took more time than I expected. I booked the CNC machine for 11 a.m and arrived at 10 a.m in order to prepare the file for RhinoCam, but it took two and a half hours to start. Beside the preparation of the drawings, there are a lot of parameters that we need to modify for cutting and pocketing. I worked with Josep and he suggested to use \u201cpocketing\u201d function to cut small holes for safety reason to prevent any accident. We also defined the screws as the first cut(work piece). I decided to use 2 different 6mm end-mills for cutting. (6mm ball for pocketing and 6mm flat for cutting) Finishing up the work at Rhino-Cam, we located the 2440X1220mm plywood on the CNC machine. The next step was defining the x-y-z for the machine. For X and Y we used our eye and for Z we used the small button attached to the CNC. The first cut was for the screws. After, applying the screws manually, the pocketing started and we needed to change the end-mill to flat for the final cutting. I made a mistake in the design and had to cut an extra piece. And during that process we made another mistake on the surface and location of the workpiece on Z coordinate. Fortunately, the work piece was over the surface and we did not had a big accident. The following steps was sanding and assembling the pieces. Unexpectedly, sanding the edges and surfaces took so much time. But, at the end I felt satisfy with the result. Building a Bedside Table by CNC cutting by caglaralkan Challenge No:2 \u00b6 We decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we designed during the challenge-1. We mostly wanted to focus on digitalization process in order to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from 2D to 3D as one of the goal that we set before. In other words, it become a playground to discover 3d fabrication which is a bridge between a physical object and digital representative, more than a tile decorating kit. We had some reference projects to help us: MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table, and Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI (Reactable). At the end we had to simplify or goals because of the time limitation. As it is a project connects the physical and digital, it has a lot of details that needs to be solved. This time, we took the base-grid as a playground and decided to let people to play, change, combine the cubes that attached to it and positioned by magnets in order to build their unique design on the grid rather than 2D geometric shapes. We started with the digitalization process. We thought a lot on the process how to convert the physical items to digital representatives. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial id\u201d works like QR codes(with more organic shapes drawings) through cameras. Fiducial IDs can be captured by any cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube that we play-locate on the grid has a unique \u201cFiducial ID\u201don it, and this gives it a parameter on the Z axis to help to form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, as camera detects the cubes on the grid and let the user to move them freely on it, we also needed to program the Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots(6x6) in order to frame design area and make the post-digitalization process easier. Through that process we had lots of problems: we couldn\u2019t solve the problem of the camera detecting the fiducials repeatedly. This process creates a lot of trash on the system and at the end we decided to reset the system as a solution to that problem. Beside the digitalization, we also worked a lot on the physical object. Firstly, we 3D printed the cubes which made of two parts and use 6 magnets in it. But, this method was not appropriate because it took 3 hours for each cube. So we ended up with the idea to build the cubes made of wood and we had to insert the magnets on surfaces. As we had sphere shape magnets, it was a real concern to be able to insert the magnets in the right magnetic directions. We designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet to eliminate that problem and we 3D printed them from raisin. Sphere shape magnets can move in the nest and find their magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we tried to raster the fudicials on cubes with laser cutter but the camera didn\u2019t detect it. Thus, we engraved the outlines and drew by hand at the end. We couldn\u2019t use vinyl because vinyl does not stick on the wood properly. Moreover, we had more trouble to cut the cubes out of the oak block. The block was 33 mm thick and we had to carve the surface 3mm to get 30mm thickness. We did that with the help of Adai and Edu. Through that process we discovered the facing function of the RhinoCam-CNC which provides the carving function with the end-mill has 30mm diameter. The other problem was to use the material efficiently: in order to eliminate material loss in CNC Adai made me to cut the cubes ( as we needed a lot of cubes) with the manual saw which needs a lot of attention and physical job. After engraving the fiducials in laser cutter we cut the cubes with manual saw and we drilled each surfaces (again) manually in order to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we used the CNC machine to build the grid out of plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic in order to build a structure to hold camera above the grid. That structure was designed in order to be located in different positions on the grid to get the right frame and capture the cubes clearly. Mostly we used the grasshopper for digitalization process. But, we also added the arduino in order to use the firefly plug-in and we also added a button to arduino in order to capture the desired design and to build that with the 3D printer. Personal note: As the challenges has to be done by groups, at a certain point projects become complicated and at that point most of the tasks has to be done by different colleagues. So normally, because of the need of using the time efficiently, each one ends up with working on the field that he/she has more experience. This ends with the lack of opportunity to improve some other skills. In short, I want to say that I prefer to have more classes on coding like the one that Oscar gave. During each challenge I was not able to improve my coding skills because as I am a maker I had to work on the machines and 3d modeling. And also we didn\u2019t have time to stay and worked-discover-learn from my classmates. To sum up, I have doubts about the efficiency of challenges. I cannot say that I didn\u2019t discover or learn anything, but I really prefer to have more time and opportunity to have more confidence in coding. But, challenge weeks are so intense and do not let me to discover-learn the coding neither from instructors nor colleagues.

But, I guess as filaments are more stable material, it was fast and easy to get the results. Furthermore, I wanted to print the model by the white filament to use it efficiently during the digital 3D scanning process, but as the white filament spool was heavy, I ended up using the black filament. As I was expecting the black filament effected the process of the digital scanning in a negative way. I was not able to scan the shark with scanner. I tried to scan a asthma-spray pump. Unfortunately, there are some missing surfaces on it. I also tried to scan the bust as it is completely white and less surfaces towards the ground. The result was neither a success, nor a disaster. As long as it hasn\u2019t a complicated organic shape, I prefer to 3D model the object rather than 3D scanning. 3D Shark with joints by caglaralkan","title":"Class Task No:5"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#class-task-no6","text":"Networking class with Victor was an introduction for creating network by using the Arduino software and local server. We worked within teams and try to connected to Victors computer by local server and Arduino software interface (especially serial monitor) In order to connect to the Victors computer we need to change some specific parts of the code on Arduino. First of all, we needed to download PunSubClient library and we had to connect to the local network by changing the Wifi name and password on the code. Then, we also had to modify the mqttClientuser (Victor), topicToSub and mqttClientName(our team name). Actually, apart from those, Marielle changed some lines on the code but I couldn\u2019t catch those parts.

I don\u2019t know if its Oscars talent but somehow he was able to explain so many thing about the coding language. At least I was able to catch the steps during the class even some difficulties happened. Oscar tried to move us forward in terms of networking through Arduino from the point that Victor started last week. Surprisingly, this was the best organized hands on learning session of the semester. We went through several steps; just by building a basic LED circuit we started with a \u201cblink\u201d command, and we tried to connected to a network and comment on a LED through an online dashboard. Then, we discovered breathe and burn commands and some important shortcuts instead of repeating the lines in coding; (int I=0;i>5;i++) Also \u201cdefining functions\u201d and \u201cif, else if command lines in the loop\u201d are the other meaningful discoveries for me. Even I am not able to figure it out completely this line.(int num_reps=3 int delay_time=500)I feel more comfortable and ready to work on coding more. Another small but unexpected problem was even the code was correct because of so many people try to connect to the server at the same time, I was not able to connect the server. It took sometime for me to figure that out. I needed to reset the Arduino in order to connect to server and synchronize my Arduino and LED circuit with the others.

As I already knew the thickness of the plywood(15mm), I decided to build an interlocking bed-side table. After modeling the piece, I thought on the modifications on drawing which is necessary for the CNC cutting. As I had decided to use 6mm end-mill, I modified the inner and outer corners of the pieces accordingly. It took more time than I expected. I booked the CNC machine for 11 a.m and arrived at 10 a.m in order to prepare the file for RhinoCam, but it took two and a half hours to start. Beside the preparation of the drawings, there are a lot of parameters that we need to modify for cutting and pocketing. I worked with Josep and he suggested to use \u201cpocketing\u201d function to cut small holes for safety reason to prevent any accident. We also defined the screws as the first cut(work piece). I decided to use 2 different 6mm end-mills for cutting. (6mm ball for pocketing and 6mm flat for cutting) Finishing up the work at Rhino-Cam, we located the 2440X1220mm plywood on the CNC machine. The next step was defining the x-y-z for the machine. For X and Y we used our eye and for Z we used the small button attached to the CNC. The first cut was for the screws. After, applying the screws manually, the pocketing started and we needed to change the end-mill to flat for the final cutting. I made a mistake in the design and had to cut an extra piece. And during that process we made another mistake on the surface and location of the workpiece on Z coordinate. Fortunately, the work piece was over the surface and we did not had a big accident. The following steps was sanding and assembling the pieces. Unexpectedly, sanding the edges and surfaces took so much time. But, at the end I felt satisfy with the result. Building a Bedside Table by CNC cutting by caglaralkan","title":"Class Task No:8"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#challenge-no2","text":"We decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we designed during the challenge-1. We mostly wanted to focus on digitalization process in order to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from 2D to 3D as one of the goal that we set before. In other words, it become a playground to discover 3d fabrication which is a bridge between a physical object and digital representative, more than a tile decorating kit. We had some reference projects to help us: MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table, and Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI (Reactable). At the end we had to simplify or goals because of the time limitation. As it is a project connects the physical and digital, it has a lot of details that needs to be solved. This time, we took the base-grid as a playground and decided to let people to play, change, combine the cubes that attached to it and positioned by magnets in order to build their unique design on the grid rather than 2D geometric shapes. We started with the digitalization process. We thought a lot on the process how to convert the physical items to digital representatives. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial id\u201d works like QR codes(with more organic shapes drawings) through cameras. Fiducial IDs can be captured by any cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube that we play-locate on the grid has a unique \u201cFiducial ID\u201don it, and this gives it a parameter on the Z axis to help to form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, as camera detects the cubes on the grid and let the user to move them freely on it, we also needed to program the Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots(6x6) in order to frame design area and make the post-digitalization process easier. Through that process we had lots of problems: we couldn\u2019t solve the problem of the camera detecting the fiducials repeatedly. This process creates a lot of trash on the system and at the end we decided to reset the system as a solution to that problem. Beside the digitalization, we also worked a lot on the physical object. Firstly, we 3D printed the cubes which made of two parts and use 6 magnets in it. But, this method was not appropriate because it took 3 hours for each cube. So we ended up with the idea to build the cubes made of wood and we had to insert the magnets on surfaces. As we had sphere shape magnets, it was a real concern to be able to insert the magnets in the right magnetic directions. We designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet to eliminate that problem and we 3D printed them from raisin. Sphere shape magnets can move in the nest and find their magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we tried to raster the fudicials on cubes with laser cutter but the camera didn\u2019t detect it. Thus, we engraved the outlines and drew by hand at the end. We couldn\u2019t use vinyl because vinyl does not stick on the wood properly. Moreover, we had more trouble to cut the cubes out of the oak block. The block was 33 mm thick and we had to carve the surface 3mm to get 30mm thickness. We did that with the help of Adai and Edu. Through that process we discovered the facing function of the RhinoCam-CNC which provides the carving function with the end-mill has 30mm diameter. The other problem was to use the material efficiently: in order to eliminate material loss in CNC Adai made me to cut the cubes ( as we needed a lot of cubes) with the manual saw which needs a lot of attention and physical job. After engraving the fiducials in laser cutter we cut the cubes with manual saw and we drilled each surfaces (again) manually in order to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we used the CNC machine to build the grid out of plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic in order to build a structure to hold camera above the grid. That structure was designed in order to be located in different positions on the grid to get the right frame and capture the cubes clearly. Mostly we used the grasshopper for digitalization process. But, we also added the arduino in order to use the firefly plug-in and we also added a button to arduino in order to capture the desired design and to build that with the 3D printer. Personal note: As the challenges has to be done by groups, at a certain point projects become complicated and at that point most of the tasks has to be done by different colleagues. So normally, because of the need of using the time efficiently, each one ends up with working on the field that he/she has more experience. This ends with the lack of opportunity to improve some other skills. In short, I want to say that I prefer to have more classes on coding like the one that Oscar gave. During each challenge I was not able to improve my coding skills because as I am a maker I had to work on the machines and 3d modeling. And also we didn\u2019t have time to stay and worked-discover-learn from my classmates. To sum up, I have doubts about the efficiency of challenges. I cannot say that I didn\u2019t discover or learn anything, but I really prefer to have more time and opportunity to have more confidence in coding. But, challenge weeks are so intense and do not let me to discover-learn the coding neither from instructors nor colleagues.

The world has changed rapidly in the last 40 years. I remember watching our first black and white television without a remote control, but now I can zip around the city on my mono-wheel without even taking a step. However, it\u2019s important to remember that many communities around the world still don\u2019t have access to basic technologies or even clean drinking water, which are essential for survival. The origin of the word \u2018design\u2019 comes from \u2018designare\u2019 in Latin, which means to draw a plan on paper. After architecture, the military, industry, technology, and philosophy, we started to use the word \u2018design\u2019 so often in daily life. I believe that the word \u2018design\u2019 that we talk about in daily life is mostly the outcome of the industrial revolution, used as an advertising agent to convince and motivate people to consume and buy a lot. Additionally, when we start to talk about today\u2019s tools, the first thing that comes to our minds is mostly about technology, which gives us the opportunity to communicate instantly, even with outer space. However, I am thinking about how accessible technology is and what all of these new technologies promise us. For instance; religions promise believers heaven, feudalism promised safety in resource and food cultivation, and capitalism promises social elevation. Any kind of alternatives should have some promises. What could new technologies and the alternative futures promise be? Are we looking forward to the day when we have personal robots that work instead of us, and will we be able to sail among the stars in total peace without worrying about anything? I will try to give some answers to three main questions with the help of todays tools and concept of design approaches. How design can reconfigure systems of extraction? Design has a significant power to challenge and reconfigure systems of extraction by questioning the dominant narratives of what is considered valuable and by considering the social and ecological implications of production and consumption. In the book \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d by Jason Moore, the author explains how the capitalist world system has relied on cheap nature, cheap labor, and cheap energy to fuel the growth of global capitalism. Design can challenge this by questioning the very concept of \u201ccheapness\u201d and reimagining what constitutes value in production and consumption. For example, design can prioritize the use of renewable resources, circular economies, and local sourcing to reduce the extraction of natural resources and the exploitation of labor. Here are some other ways in which design can help reconfigure systems of extraction at first glance: Redesigning products: Designers can help reduce the demand for extractive resources by creating products that are designed for longevity, repairability, and reuse. By designing products that can be easily disassembled and repaired, designers can reduce the need for new resource extraction. Material innovation: Designers can help reduce the environmental impact of resource extraction by developing new materials that are more sustainable and require fewer resources. For example, designers can develop plant-based alternatives to synthetic materials or create new composite materials that are more durable and require fewer resources to produce. Circular economy: Designers can help create a circular economy that minimizes waste and promotes resource efficiency. By designing products and systems that are designed for reuse and recycling, designers can help reduce the need for new resource extraction. Sustainable infrastructure: Designers can help create sustainable infrastructure that reduces the need for extractive resources. For example, designers can create buildings that generate their own energy, reduce water consumption, and minimize waste. Community engagement: Designers can work with local communities to identify their needs and develop solutions that are tailored to their unique circumstances. By engaging with communities that are directly impacted by extractive industries, designers can help create solutions that are more equitable and sustainable. To sum up, design has the potential to play a significant role in reconfiguring systems of extraction by promoting sustainable practices and reducing the environmental impact of resource extraction. Which worlds and futures can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? Today\u2019s tools, such as digital technology and advanced materials, provide designers with unprecedented capabilities to envision and create new worlds. In the book \u201cDesign as Participation\u201d by Kevin Slavin, the author argues that design has the power to shape our social and political realities. Design can be used to imagine and create new social, economic, and political systems that promote social justice, environmental sustainability, and human well-being which is the most important. For example, designers can use virtual and augmented reality to simulate new forms of urban planning or community engagement. They can use advanced materials to create sustainable and resilient infrastructure that responds to the challenges of climate change. I think that any system designed in advance or that grows over time eventually starts to behave like a living organism, searching for alternative ways to sustain itself. For example, the transition from feudalism to capitalism was facilitated by the production of sugar in Madeira. The island\u2019s forests were destroyed to cultivate sugarcane and use it as a fuel source. When the forests were depleted, new solutions were invented, such as cultivating grapes and supplying cheap wood from new markets. As Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore argue in the their book \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d, \u2018Suppose we consider capitalism as an illness; then, it is a disease that consumes your body and profits from selling your remains as fertilizer. The profits earned from selling the fertilizer are then invested in cultivating sugarcane and selling it to visitors who pay to see your grave.\u2019 Here are more examples of the worlds and futures that we can design with today\u2019s tools: Virtual Worlds: With the advancement of technology, we can now design and create virtual worlds that are incredibly realistic and immersive. These worlds can be used for entertainment, education, and even training. Augmented Reality Worlds: Augmented reality (AR) allows us to overlay digital content onto the real world. We can design AR worlds that enhance our surroundings, such as adding information to a museum exhibit or creating an interactive game in a park. 3D Printing Worlds: 3D printing technology has given us the power to create physical objects from digital designs. With 3D printing, we can design and create entire worlds, such as miniature models of cities or landscapes. Space Exploration Worlds: With the help of space exploration tools, we can design and explore worlds beyond our own. We can use telescopes, rovers, and other tools to explore other planets, moons, and even asteroids. Artificial Intelligence Worlds: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to create intelligent agents that can interact with their environment. With AI, we can design and create worlds where these agents can learn and evolve, such as in simulation environments or video games. Human well-being worlds: Design can be used to create a human well-being future with today\u2019s tools by focusing on designing with and for people, rather than simply designing for profit or aesthetics. As Kevin Slavin called this approach \u201cDesign as Participation\u201d, involves actively involving people in the design process and empowering them to shape the products and services that affect their lives. According to Slavin, \u201cDesign as Participation is a way of working that acknowledges and responds to the reality of an interconnected world, where the inputs and outputs of a design are entangled with everything else.\u201d This means that designers must consider the broader social, economic, and environmental impact of their designs, and actively engage with the communities they are designing for. One example of Design as Participation in action is the \u201cTrash Track\u201d project, which was created by the MIT Sensible City Lab. This project used GPS-enabled devices to track the movement of trash through the city, allowing people to better understand the environmental impact of their waste and make more informed decisions about their consumption habits. By involving people in the design process and using technology to create more transparent and participatory systems, Design as Participation has the potential to create a more sustainable, equitable, and human-centered future. In conclusion, with the power of today\u2019s tools, we can design and create a wide range of worlds limited only by our creativity and imagination. Unfortunately, the capacity of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201ctodays tools\u201d that we know and talk about today is not only a result of systems such as capitalism, feudalism, and technology, but is also largely a product of the Industrial Revolution. While the concept of design may have no limit, our personal imaginations and creativity do have limits. Perhaps the concept of a collective-collaborative minds work better in terms of creativity and has more capacity and tools. On the other hand, technology, which is supposed to serve people, causes, supports, and makes every single person on the planet live, act, and behave more individually. In other words, I am doubtful about the role and power of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201c\u201dtodays tools\u201d in terms of alternative ways of living, which are supposed to be better. How can we design the transition towards these worlds and futures? Designing the transition towards more sustainable and just worlds requires a shift from traditional design approaches that focus on products and services to participatory design approaches that engage diverse stakeholders in the design process. In the book \u201cSteps to an Ecology of Mind\u201d by Gregory Bateson, the author argues that the key to creating more sustainable and resilient systems is to focus on the relationships between different elements and actors in the system. Design can facilitate this by engaging diverse stakeholders in the design process, including marginalized communities, workers, and environmental groups. By involving these groups, designers can create more inclusive and equitable systems that respond to the needs and aspirations of all members of society. Moreover, to design a transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a deliberate and strategic approach. Here are some steps that can help facilitate the transition: Set clear goals: To design a transition towards the desired future, we must first establish clear goals and objectives. These goals should be specific, measurable, and actionable, and should reflect the vision for the future. Collaborate: Achieving the desired future will require collaboration across different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals. Collaboration should be fostered through partnerships, co-creation, and open dialogue. Experiment and Prototype: The design of the transition should be iterative, with experiments and prototypes testing and refining ideas before scaling. This approach will allow us to learn from failures and successes, and adjust course as needed. Enable Policy Frameworks: Governments and other policymakers should create the enabling policy frameworks to support the transition. This could include regulations, incentives, and other policy tools to promote sustainable development, social inclusion, and technological innovation. Invest in Innovation: To facilitate the transition, there is a need for investment in innovation and research and development. This could include investments in new technologies, business models, and social innovations that support the desired future. Empower Local Communities: Local communities play a critical role in the transition towards the desired future. Empowering them to participate in the design and implementation of the transition will help to ensure that the transition is inclusive and equitable. As a result, designing the transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a collaborative and inclusive approach, with a focus on experimentation, innovation, and policy frameworks that support the transition. Personal Note; Cash is king, and capital is power, but what was the source of power before that? Physical power? Success? Heritage? There are various sources of power, including physical power for protection and defense, communal power for protection of family, tribe and land, religious power, financial power, resource power, and information-technology power. In all cases, demand and supply also play a key role. What about the power of colonialism? While we criticize the colonial attempts of Europe, many people around the world are trying to obtain a passport from the European Union today. What is the motivation behind that? I believe that, more than the American dream of becoming rich easily, the main motivation and need of human beings is safety. People feel safer within the borders of the European Union than anywhere else. Maybe, first of all it is better to analyze the source of that feeling of safety within the European Union.

Collaborate: Achieving the desired future will require collaboration across different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals. Collaboration should be fostered through partnerships, co-creation, and open dialogue. Experiment and Prototype: The design of the transition should be iterative, with experiments and prototypes testing and refining ideas before scaling. This approach will allow us to learn from failures and successes, and adjust course as needed. Enable Policy Frameworks: Governments and other policymakers should create the enabling policy frameworks to support the transition. This could include regulations, incentives, and other policy tools to promote sustainable development, social inclusion, and technological innovation. Invest in Innovation: To facilitate the transition, there is a need for investment in innovation and research and development. This could include investments in new technologies, business models, and social innovations that support the desired future. Empower Local Communities: Local communities play a critical role in the transition towards the desired future. Empowering them to participate in the design and implementation of the transition will help to ensure that the transition is inclusive and equitable. As a result, designing the transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a collaborative and inclusive approach, with a focus on experimentation, innovation, and policy frameworks that support the transition. Personal Note; Cash is king, and capital is power, but what was the source of power before that? Physical power? Success? Heritage? There are various sources of power, including physical power for protection and defense, communal power for protection of family, tribe and land, religious power, financial power, resource power, and information-technology power. In all cases, demand and supply also play a key role. What about the power of colonialism? While we criticize the colonial attempts of Europe, many people around the world are trying to obtain a passport from the European Union today. What is the motivation behind that? I believe that, more than the American dream of becoming rich easily, the main motivation and need of human beings is safety. People feel safer within the borders of the European Union than anywhere else. Maybe, first of all it is better to analyze the source of that feeling of safety within the European Union.

Then we decided to work on the subject of \u201cWork-Life balance\u201d. We were aware that it was a broad subject. So, we decided to build a circuit with LDR sensor and gather data on how much time we are spending inside and how much time left us from work to see some daylight? After building the LDR sensor circuit we made some configurations as changing the resistor to 1K to get appropriate numbers in order to get the different values for inside and outside brigthness. The next step was to restoring the data from the LDR sensor. We tried to use bluetooth through our mobile phones(with the idea of carrying the sensor with us everywhere), but it was quite complicated process and we couldn\u2019t succeed at the end. We ended up the decision of using wifi. Josep helped us to figure out how to store the data by downloading Arduspreadsheets and logging the LDR data in a .csv file. We used If This Then That (IFTTT) to connect to Webhooks to publish the data over Wifi. After this we were able to connect the ESP32 to a phone hotspot and the device was mobile. The LDR sensor sent the value of the light that it detected every six seconds. On the other hand, as our time was limited, we tried to gather more info through web, results of some surveys and research through an application called Orange3. We found a big research called \u201cWorld Happiness Report\u201d and we analyzed that with the help of Orange3. But, we figured out that it was more related with socio-economic information. Then, we also tried to acquire info from a survey that made by OECD.Stat which shows the percentage of adults who reported that over the last 12 months it has been difficult for them to fulfill their family responsibilities because of the amount of time they spent at work. In order to gather informations and graphics that we wanted, we had to install some add-on for Orange3 and for Mac version it took so much time. The third step to get information through web was using twitter data and analysis of some tweets through specific keywords. The process could be done by text-mining add-on. We went through several analysing and data visualising tools as SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, BOX PLOT-emotion analyze, Corpus Viewer, Word Cloud, Preprocess Text\u2026 The work we did mostly about the methodology. We did not have the chance to gather correct and appropriate data within two days to propose a solution to our hypothesis. But, the discovery of this methodology was really useful for future-works. According to me, it is essential to design a balanced scenario to capture the data through sensors by first hands and support that by using the data that already captured by several applications through web and networks.

So, technology is the agent of social change as it moulds society and changes our behaviours. On the other hand, if we are smart enough we should know that we can be out of technology in some cases. We should have some social skills (maybe more than just social) in order to survive. I attended the first day of the class and I enjoyed it a lot and I tried to participate and gave some examples about the baby care item and general culture in my own country. How it is seen to have a baby and how much support you can have from your parents and friends during the first years when you have a baby. I attended the second class through FaceTime with the help of my friend and I tried to listen the lecture and discussions. But, it was not as efficient as in person. I did my best. During the discussion at class in the first day on the marketing approaches of two different brands which sell a new-born product to support the parents were completely different yet still both took the baby as a source of problems and focus on bringing a solution to that problem. This approach is totally against the idea of having a child but somehow technologies (in terms of marketing) are taken as services to problems. On the other hand, ChatGPT is the focus of every daily conversation nowadays. Mostly, the main critic is its popularity among the students and especially using it for their homework. Some of my friends are teaching in schools and I discuss this with them a lot. They are complaining about plagiarism. I have doubts about if this is plagiarism or not. According to me it is like using google. There are lots of information on google. But, you need to know what you are looking for and using ChatGPT is like that, you need to know what is the right question to ask him/her. To be honest, I am the last generation in my country to learn how to write an essay properly(I am 40) So, writing skills is not so common among the young generations. At least not for more than 140/280 character. To sum up this part, I believe that ChatGPT is not a miracle to solve all the problems or able to do every single homework. I also found these three relations interesting; Embodiment relation of mediation human + technology = world Glasses - if a person always wears glasses or contacts then it is always relevant in their perception of the world.
