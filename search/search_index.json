My Alternative Presents \u201cParticipative Design Processes\u201d that include digital fabrication tools and combine them with traditional production techniques encourage makers to be more productive in urban spaces and support them in integrating technology into their workspaces in the age of the post-industrial revolution. In other words, makers gain confidence in using new technologies in their work and seamlessly blend traditional techniques with digital fabrication tools to enhance productivity both individually and within their communities, with the aid of \u201cParticipative Design Processes\u201d. Personally, I am keen on further developing Participative Design Processes by organizing more events, collaborating with different maker spaces, and engaging with other networks. Consulting on participative design processes will lead me down different paths and enable me to gain deeper insights into the design and production processes. Furthermore, documenting and publishing these processes can create more opportunities to establish new connections and networks. In summary, harnessing the potential of collective making, thinking, and designing is crucial in promoting participative design processes.

But, resulted from our experiences we have some practices. Methods of Prototyping and Experimentation in RtD \u00b6 role 1 : The prototype as an experimental component; It\u2019s a very helpful method to develop a product that already exists. In industrial design we can call it redesign . It\u2019s also so common in usability labs for testing different user approaches , it\u2019s not only to test interfaces but also to develop some user friendly forms and attachments. I practiced this method on many design project for instance; a portable X-RAY machine. We tried various designs for interface and most importantly we tried alternatives by dividing the machine into parts to make it easy to use but mostly in order to make it less harmful for the operators, as they are exposed to x-rays a lot. role 4 : The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry; I think this method is more efficient to test new concepts . More or less I also experienced this method to generate a new concept for alcohol meter design. It was a station-kiosk which designed to be used by self decision to inform the driver to warn before start the engine. It was quite helpful to use first digital based prototype to see if the idea works second physical prototypes to test the usability and interactions. role 3 : The prototype as a research archetype; This method would lead some ideas and projects to creative solutions, the examples on the presentation looked really breathtaking.

Communication Methods and Mediums \u00b6 Urban productivity practices Urban farming/ Urban growing/ Maker spaces/ Productive domestic spaces/ Productive community places/ Productive public places(meeting points It isn\u2019t easy to name or specify it, but all the productive practices above needs a kind of knowledge in any case. On the other hand, the amount of knowledge or the way of sharing the necessary info to do productive practices effects the creativity and possible developments in a negative way. So, communication methods and mediums should be determined so carefully in order to have a sustainable productivity and creativity. Stop motion videos, Video journaling, Icons or drawings to make it easy to understand the topics presented, Photographing, and Infographics, would be some ways to document, to show, to explain and give ideas/inspirations/motivations/support the people that I am planning to collaborate. But communication methods and mediums can change according to the locations and number of people that I want to reach. For example; *If I start to do sth at my terrace and collaborate with the people just in my building or just with the MDEF people, a single WhatsApp group and some quick posters and short videos would help to built and support the community. *If I start with a community garden and collaborate with in a neighbourhood, then a Facebook group or an Instagram page would help me to communicate better in terms of communication and support me to reach more people. Additionally, instagram stories and posts will be better to see the progress and the documentation of my project. As the scale of the project change communication mediums and methods need to be considered and redesigned according to take more benefit. First interventions (Experiments, Pilots and first collective intervention): \u00b6 Description and results; \u00b6 Since the industrial revolution most of the people believe that production processes are so difficult and hard to deal with. The approach of most of the manufacturers is to make the consumers completely depended on them. Basically, we can see the example of this approach by the smartphone companies. Apple is almost about to become a monopoly in the smartphone industry and it doesn\u2019t want us to open the phone to see what is inside. We\u2019ve become so lazy and unconfident because black boxes made us to think they are so complicated. We become like machines just to consume, buy anything without thinking if we need them with the help of ads on everywhere. But small communities which try to collapse that bias of producing things is impossible by DIY projects nowadays. And so far from my experiences the main idea is to provide spaces for individuals in those communities. Mostly people want to feel that they have spaces in somewhere, in other words the need to feel belonging somewhere some place, some people without being judged and feel confident. Production Party Interventions: \u00b6 As a first collective intervention I collaborated with Ahmed and Korbi. They have completely different backgrounds; Ahmed is a architect and Korbi is coming from philosophy and international relationship fields. So as an industrial designer it was not easy to design a common project to work on without patronizing my teammates. Our common view point was the desire and need of personal and communal productivity and hacking the supply chain that imposed on us since the industrial revolution. That\u2019s why we decided to name our interventions \u201cproduction party\u201d. Firstly, we used to have different ideas individually about a potential intervention due to test the productivity in the urban spaces. I had the desire to work on something related to urban farming because I already contacted with three different community gardens in Barcelona. Ahmed wanted to work on fabrics and experience sawing and Korbi wanted to built a nomad furniture in order to test the recipe that he found on web. The main struggle about having different ideas and projects resulted from the comfort zone trouble. Each of us felt safer in our own comfort zone. We ended up with the idea of building a vase out of clay that we had designed on Rhinoceros by layers (which can be produced through 3D printer) and to do so, firstly Ahmed and me shared our knowledge of Rhinoceros and 3D modeling with Korbi. It was an efficient warm up exercise for us to get use to each other. None of us had the knowledge or experience on clay as a material. So, it was completely a discovery for three of us. Secondly, we decided to design an intervention by including our MDEF community. We discussed a lot on different ideas. At the end we planned to built two different items out of cardboards with two different instructions and within two groups. (We chose cardboard scraps as a main material, because it\u2019s a material quite accessible and according to me cardboard has incredible potential) It was an efficient method for me to see the difference between two recipes, processes and outcomes. As I had some knowledge on working with cardboard, I preferred to work with printed patterns of a rocking horse, while the second group tried to built a chair by drawing and following the instructions. The first two question appeared in minds while cutting the pieces were the direction and the thickness of the cardboards that needed to built the item. The process of \u201cthe production party intervention\u201d showed us how important is that to have appropriate, good and enough instructions to built something by your own especially when you don\u2019t have enough knowledge and experience on the subject. Additionally, I am quite familiar with this subject from the years that I worked in IKEA. As a retailer of self assembled furnitures, manual designs are very important topic for the company. Manuals, instructions or recipe book, however we called them would be a potential project that we can work on in order to support the concept of some DIY projects. Lastly, our last intervention happened within a workshop which was organized by CdEF -Caixa d\u2019Eines i Feines- a \u201csharing chain\u201d. It was more than a sewing workshop; they are sharing knowledge, machines, tools, materials, space, energy and care with participants-guests. We were able to share a lot in a single evening. As I have some experience and knowledge in sewing, \u0131 tried to encourage my teammates -Ahmed and Korbi- in order to use the sewing machine. It was the first time that Ahmed experienced to saw with machine. We patched some items and we were able to built a fabric shopping bag that we had tried to sew by hand before. We were able to see the difference between the processes when we gain some experience and have better instructions. As a team we also tried to encourage other participants, who came there for the first time and has few knowledge and experience on the topic like us, to involve in the process. It was another efficient experience for me. I figured out personal productivity needs some motivation and support especially when you have little knowledge and experience on the topic. At this point I think it\u2019s really necessary to provide space for individuals to feel confident within the communities like this. Experiencing or trying together by sharing knowledge rather than teaching directly, and encouraging even ends up with fail. And finally, two basic questions appeared in my mind; What discourages you to start your own DIY project? What can motivate you to start your own DIY project?","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20Studio%20I/#vision-and-goals","text":"It\u2019s not easy to be totally aware that what kind of abilities, skills or knowledge we have.

Since the pandemic started we all started to spend more time indoor for ourselves and for our hobbies. I guess its instinctive that most of us at least tried to grow some plants and vegetables.

Since my childhood I like to watch documentaries. The concept Human 2.0 is one of my favorite subject and I like to read, listen and watch about that. I share below some articles and documentaries and TedX Talks about the subject and also a bit of my view point and some of my questions. https://www.kepach.it/film/man-20/ As humans we are quite fragile physically, we have limited capabilities. We couldn\u2019t synthesized most of the amino acids and vitamins even Vitamin C. We need to get them from the nature. But we are creative and since the beginning of the time we are inventing tools to compensate our physical disadvantages. Tools for hunting, foraging, constructing and etc. We also invented some tools to overcome some of our physical disabilities; glasses, contact lenses, laser machines for eye surgery. We invented hi-tech prosthesis for people who lost some body parts, but so long ago we started to produce shoes to protect our feet and continued to run faster. Since twenty years there are so many projects developed on outer skeleton to improve our physical endurance. https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2018/10/01/human-2-0-is-coming-faster-than-you-think-will-you-evolve-with-the-times/?sh=3ad5ea1d4284 And soon it will be possible to use genome sequence and gene therapy (intervention) to get rid of most of the diseases and disabilities that we have related to our genomes. We will be able to to reach the perfect and healthiest and long lasting bodies which will accompany us during our lifetime. Will we be able to modify our eyes with the help of genetic engineering and other biotechnologies to see the outer space? Can we use gene therapy to have stronger, longer muscle legs than Usain Bolt without training? https://medium.com/@publishing_20721/human-2-0-how-far-will-future-humans-go-to-upgrade-their-bodies-b24c9af6375 Among so many, the first question that I have in my mind about genetic interventions is \u201cwhy are we focusing that much on physical perfection and improvement and we are ignoring psychological health and emotional values that we have so much? The genome perfection will be a great way to get rid of so many diseases like muscle loss, Alzheimer, cancer and this will be a great opportunity to spend the resources to develop the humanity rather than curing those diseases. https://www.redalyc.org/journal/5117/511767145020/html/ On the other hand, is that a threat for the genetic diversity of the humankind? I can say that most of the GMOs looks healthy and great but they are far away from being delicious than the locally and traditionally produced ones. As humans I am wondering if we will end up like that? Physically fit and perfect in terms of beauty but boring, monotype and tasteless in terms of social skills and with lack of humor. 2 DIY gadgets and MDEF people","title":"BioAgri"},{"location":"term1/04-Bio%20and%20Agri/#bio-and-agri","text":"Human 2.0 Upgrading the human body, with gadgets, bio-tech prosthesis, surgeries and genome imperfection.

Since twenty years there are so many projects developed on outer skeleton to improve our physical endurance. https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2018/10/01/human-2-0-is-coming-faster-than-you-think-will-you-evolve-with-the-times/?sh=3ad5ea1d4284 And soon it will be possible to use genome sequence and gene therapy (intervention) to get rid of most of the diseases and disabilities that we have related to our genomes. We will be able to to reach the perfect and healthiest and long lasting bodies which will accompany us during our lifetime. Will we be able to modify our eyes with the help of genetic engineering and other biotechnologies to see the outer space? Can we use gene therapy to have stronger, longer muscle legs than Usain Bolt without training? https://medium.com/@publishing_20721/human-2-0-how-far-will-future-humans-go-to-upgrade-their-bodies-b24c9af6375 Among so many, the first question that I have in my mind about genetic interventions is \u201cwhy are we focusing that much on physical perfection and improvement and we are ignoring psychological health and emotional values that we have so much? The genome perfection will be a great way to get rid of so many diseases like muscle loss, Alzheimer, cancer and this will be a great opportunity to spend the resources to develop the humanity rather than curing those diseases. https://www.redalyc.org/journal/5117/511767145020/html/ On the other hand, is that a threat for the genetic diversity of the humankind? I can say that most of the GMOs looks healthy and great but they are far away from being delicious than the locally and traditionally produced ones. As humans I am wondering if we will end up like that? Physically fit and perfect in terms of beauty but boring, monotype and tasteless in terms of social skills and with lack of humor. 2 DIY gadgets and MDEF people","title":"Bio and Agri"},{"location":"term1/05-Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/","text":"Living with Your Own Ideas \u00b6 In the middle of the cities we don\u2019t grow vegetables or we don\u2019t need to collect rain water.

But, since I arrived Barcelona I have the opportunity to spend more time on this concept. I attended Laras project presentation of \u201cAlmacen de Residues\u201d and I found it really interesting in terms of making the scale up by collaborating with restaurants and community gardens. I was not able to attend the paper and soap workshop because I was so sick at that moment, but her works changed my perception to the biomaterial concept. This week we started with so much practices and we worked within the groups. Seher, Ahmed and me we tried to build some bio materials with two different recipes very first day; For the first one, we had 60 grams of coffee scrub, avocado and kiwi peels and oak leafs mixture. I guess because of the volume of coffee scrub 60 grams of food waste was a bit much for the station 4 recipe with the 45 grs. pine resin, 15 ml. alcohol and 5 grs. carnauba wax. The most amazing part of first recipe was to press the mixture with the mold. Probably that reminded me mold making and crafts processes which I worked on a lot.

Material exploration \u00b6 onion peels by Seher Krishna As a group, Seher led us to discover about biomaterials. She has some experiences on that. We deceided to work with onion peels as onion is used widely all around the world and almost every cuisine have it. As the main idea is to work with some wastes, we decided to collaborate with a restaurant called Jerusalem in Poblenou and Micampus community for onion peels and we got coffee grounds from Itnig. After searching the properties of onion peels we decided to focus on the color and light reflection. Firstly, we work on starch base recipe to make the bioplastic. But, we were not happy with the elasticity of the result and even one of the trials was a fail because of using the onion peels without processing it into the blender. The material stuck on the mold. Secondly, we worked on gelatin base recipe. It gave us the elastic property that we need on the third day, but we remarked that the material has to be cut into pieces (at least by cutter/hand) on the third day, otherwise it looses its elasticity because it becomes dry and not let us to cut by hand. Additionally, it looses its flatness. Moreover, we figured out that the one made of starch with intense onion peels became usable as it becomes drier. So, I think to make a data sheet is needed to work on bio materials. On the other hand, we tried to design a lamp made of gelatin base bioplastic and pine resin base bio material for the stand of the lamp. But, we also failed with pine resin recipe. As we talked with Paige, we agree on the idea of over heating the mixture could be the possible cause of fail. My learnings are mostly on technical details as; timing and method for application is an important point to focus on. Some material samples need more time to dry and work on it, but some others need to be cut and shaped immediately in order to get the best result.

But, since I arrived Barcelona I have the opportunity to spend more time on this concept. I attended Laras project presentation of \u201cAlmacen de Residues\u201d and I found it really interesting in terms of making the scale up by collaborating with restaurants and community gardens. I was not able to attend the paper and soap workshop because I was so sick at that moment, but her works changed my perception to the biomaterial concept. This week we started with so much practices and we worked within the groups. Seher, Ahmed and me we tried to build some bio materials with two different recipes very first day; For the first one, we had 60 grams of coffee scrub, avocado and kiwi peels and oak leafs mixture. I guess because of the volume of coffee scrub 60 grams of food waste was a bit much for the station 4 recipe with the 45 grs. pine resin, 15 ml. alcohol and 5 grs. carnauba wax. The most amazing part of first recipe was to press the mixture with the mold. Probably that reminded me mold making and crafts processes which I worked on a lot.

I am confident with the circuits, but coding language is still complicated for me. I guess it will take some time to get familiar and feel comfortable about this language. I searched and found a code to work the piezzo buzzer on ESP32 feather on arduino. I tried to figure out about the whole code, but still I am still far away to be able to design one by my own. circuit by caglaralkan Class Task No:2 \u00b6 As a second task, after the presentation about the 2D-3D modeling softwares, I decided to discover Grasshopper. I am good at using Rhineceros as a 3D modeling application, but mostly I am a bit old fashion. My knowledge based on more technical aspects. If I want to change a small thing on my design after finalizing a 3D model, I need to start to work from the beginning. So, Ahmed helped me to discover Grasshopper and now I do understand what is parametric design is in a better way. As we are planning to work on a modular indoor water-wall, it would be useful for me to design with the help of parametric design tools. discovering grasshopper by caglaralkan Class Task No:3 \u00b6 By using Rhineceros I designed a laptop-stand which stands by the idea of interlocking. As a first step, I checked the materials and their thicknesses. The material thickness is the most important factor for interlocking designs because hacks-notches are keys for the quality of the design. After discussing with Adai about the design and tolerances of the outlines, I modified my design according to fit the pieces on a single cardboard (60X100cm). I cut 2 pieces as a demo in order to test the hacks-notches to get the best results and stability of the stand. During the process I figured out how to use the laser cutter. Beyond the procedures that we have to follow, technical details as; the order of the pieces that we want to cut classified by color coding, and the datas about different materials for various thicknesses and colors hanging on the wall is quite helpful to learn about the details. On the other hand, interface of the software to use the laser cutter is quite easy and clear. Thanks to Adai and Josep again for their support. Interlocking - Cardboard Laptop Stand by caglaralkan Class Task No:4 \u00b6 Building a telegraph like device with LDR and LED with arduino was the fourth task. Even it looked like simple to work with photocell and LED an first glance, it was not possible to go further and built a code for decoding the light signals into Morse code. We started to work with Ahmed on circuit of LDR-photocell and we found the code to work, we thought that we succeed in that but after Victor joined us he remarked that there is a problem with the code because there were a lot of noise in the reading of the amount of the light. As I remember correctly we damaged one Ahmed\u2019s board because we connected the LDR to 5V pin rather than 3-3.3V and it was the main reason of that noise. Then, we continued with the LED circuit. But, we couldn\u2019t achieved with ESP32 and as Wen joined us, we tried to build the circuit with Arduino-UNO. We tried several circuits and codes but we failed. After Victor helped us we checked the items of the circuit with Multimeter and we discovered that one of the cables misbehaved! Additionally, we have learned another important thing about coding; the code is not active on an additional page and it has to be in color to work which we missed. Finally, we put the LDR and LED circuits in a box and tried to build an isolated environment to read the signals from LED when we push the bouton shortly and longer. But, the code that we found to encode and decode the readings and convert those into Morse code and letters had so much lines of problems. So, we were not able to go further in order to build a telegraph with LDR and LED. LDR circuit and Code by caglaralkan Challenge No:1 \u00b6 As a group, after discussing about our common interest and as we want to work on water bricks to store domestic grey water, we decided to work on something related to modularity, interchangeability, personalisation of a product\u2026 We ended up with the idea of building a DIY toolkit which provides designing unique tile decorations and patterns made of those. Firstly, we talked on 3D and 2D options and then we decided to focus on 2D option. For a simple tile decoration we need vinyl designs which needs to be sticked on stencil to transfer the ceramic ink. Instead of providing ready to use patterns, stickers, vinyls we preferred to work on a grid board which provides the user to make their own unique design. Tile-Deco is a concept of grid that made of acrylic and magnets and has geometric pieces which can be located on and stick by magnets to the grid in order to form various tile decorations. Through the design process of the grid board we tried to prevent from shades and reflections which ruins the quality of the photo-digitalisation process of the vinyl. But, as the acrylic thickness and magnet sizes are defined, we couldn\u2019t avoid from that. On the other hand, we covered the acrylic surfaces with a mat vinyl to prevent the reflections. At least we succeeded to get rid of the reflections to enhance the quality of the photo-digitalisation process. But, of course the transfer of the vinyl on the grid board was not easy, we were not satisfied with the first attempt and for the second one magnets destroyed the grid engraved vinyl and fortunately we satisfied with the third vinyl design. Another problem that we faced with was the unsuitability of some geometric pieces which helps to generate the tile decoration design. Some geometric items has only a single magnet on them and this cause a unstable position on the gird. (During the presentation one of the constructive critic was to make the grid board double size in order tom prevent this problem, this could be a perfect solution for the problem) The next step was making the patterns aligned with the photo-digitalisation process. As we took some tile decoration samples photos and we also worked on the various patterns options on 2D softwares. We used Illustrator and Inkscape to generate some patterns. To sum up, the grid board building process was a good experience to use the laser cutter after designing that on Rhinoceros and worked on the technical details to get the best results with the magnets we had to locate on the grid. The final result can be improved by using a thinner and mat acrylic and also by using smaller magnets. This will prevent the shades during the photo-digitalisation process and improve the quality of the edges of the tile decorations. Additionally, building it double size will provide all geometric shapes which helps to build the tile decoration completely stable on the grid. As a development plan; we can continue with 3D options but, we are not sure about how to integrate electronics on our project to develop for the next stages. Tile Deco by caglaralkan Repository link; https://github.com/paresmarc/tiledeco Class Task No:5 \u00b6 Contrary to the previous tasks, rather than modeling some basic thing on Rhinoceros I decided to download a 3D shark model which has has connected pieces in order to test the 3D printers capacity. I downloaded the file from \u201cthingiverse.com\u201d and I discovered that the file has some specifications to help-support the printing process; as if it needs support for being built\u2026 After exported the file in .stl format, I opened that in Ultimaker-Cura and slice it. Surprisingly, 3D printing process with filaments is easier than 3D printing process of clay. When we tried to print some water brick samples made of clay by 3D printing, we had to make 4-5 tests for nozzle distance and speed in order to get the best results. But, I guess as filaments are more stable material, it was fast and easy to get the results. Furthermore, I wanted to print the model by the white filament to use it efficiently during the digital 3D scanning process, but as the white filament spool was heavy, I ended up using the black filament. As I was expecting the black filament effected the process of the digital scanning in a negative way. I was not able to scan the shark with scanner. I tried to scan a asthma-spray pump. Unfortunately, there are some missing surfaces on it. I also tried to scan the bust as it is completely white and less surfaces towards the ground. The result was neither a success, nor a disaster. As long as it hasn\u2019t a complicated organic shape, I prefer to 3D model the object rather than 3D scanning. 3D Shark with joints by caglaralkan Class Task No:6 \u00b6 Networking class with Victor was an introduction for creating network by using the Arduino software and local server. We worked within teams and try to connected to Victors computer by local server and Arduino software interface (especially serial monitor) In order to connect to the Victors computer we need to change some specific parts of the code on Arduino. First of all, we needed to download PunSubClient library and we had to connect to the local network by changing the Wifi name and password on the code. Then, we also had to modify the mqttClientuser (Victor), topicToSub and mqttClientName(our team name). Actually, apart from those, Marielle changed some lines on the code but I couldn\u2019t catch those parts. On the other hand, we were able to modify the message that we sent to Victors computer ( rather than saying \u201chello!\u201d) Coding for Network by caglaralkan Class Task No:7 \u00b6 Beyond blink-breathe-burn, todays class should be named as Coding Language-101. We started the session with \u201cHow hard can it be to turn on a LED?\u201dand I can say that it would be so hard sometimes because of a misbehaved cable or disfunction LED or a wrong type of resistor. I don\u2019t know if its Oscars talent but somehow he was able to explain so many thing about the coding language. At least I was able to catch the steps during the class even some difficulties happened. Oscar tried to move us forward in terms of networking through Arduino from the point that Victor started last week. Surprisingly, this was the best organized hands on learning session of the semester. We went through several steps; just by building a basic LED circuit we started with a \u201cblink\u201d command, and we tried to connected to a network and comment on a LED through an online dashboard. Then, we discovered breathe and burn commands and some important shortcuts instead of repeating the lines in coding; (int I=0;i>5;i++) Also \u201cdefining functions\u201d and \u201cif, else if command lines in the loop\u201d are the other meaningful discoveries for me. Even I am not able to figure it out completely this line.(int num_reps=3 int delay_time=500)I feel more comfortable and ready to work on coding more. Another small but unexpected problem was even the code was correct because of so many people try to connect to the server at the same time, I was not able to connect the server. It took sometime for me to figure that out. I needed to reset the Arduino in order to connect to server and synchronize my Arduino and LED circuit with the others. Coding Language-101 by caglaralkan Class Task No:8 \u00b6 I started my CNC task by modeling a bed-side table on Rhinoceros. As I already knew the thickness of the plywood(15mm), I decided to build an interlocking bed-side table. After modeling the piece, I thought on the modifications on drawing which is necessary for the CNC cutting. As I had decided to use 6mm end-mill, I modified the inner and outer corners of the pieces accordingly. It took more time than I expected. I booked the CNC machine for 11 a.m and arrived at 10 a.m in order to prepare the file for RhinoCam, but it took two and a half hours to start. Beside the preparation of the drawings, there are a lot of parameters that we need to modify for cutting and pocketing. I worked with Josep and he suggested to use \u201cpocketing\u201d function to cut small holes for safety reason to prevent any accident. We also defined the screws as the first cut(work piece). I decided to use 2 different 6mm end-mills for cutting. (6mm ball for pocketing and 6mm flat for cutting) Finishing up the work at Rhino-Cam, we located the 2440X1220mm plywood on the CNC machine. The next step was defining the x-y-z for the machine. For X and Y we used our eye and for Z we used the small button attached to the CNC. The first cut was for the screws. After, applying the screws manually, the pocketing started and we needed to change the end-mill to flat for the final cutting. I made a mistake in the design and had to cut an extra piece. And during that process we made another mistake on the surface and location of the workpiece on Z coordinate. Fortunately, the work piece was over the surface and we did not had a big accident. The following steps was sanding and assembling the pieces. Unexpectedly, sanding the edges and surfaces took so much time. But, at the end I felt satisfy with the result. Building a Bedside Table by CNC cutting by caglaralkan Challenge No:2 \u00b6 We decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we designed during the challenge-1. We mostly wanted to focus on digitalization process in order to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from 2D to 3D as one of the goal that we set before. In other words, it become a playground to discover 3d fabrication which is a bridge between a physical object and digital representative, more than a tile decorating kit. We had some reference projects to help us: MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table, and Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI (Reactable). At the end we had to simplify or goals because of the time limitation. As it is a project connects the physical and digital, it has a lot of details that needs to be solved. This time, we took the base-grid as a playground and decided to let people to play, change, combine the cubes that attached to it and positioned by magnets in order to build their unique design on the grid rather than 2D geometric shapes. We started with the digitalization process. We thought a lot on the process how to convert the physical items to digital representatives. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial id\u201d works like QR codes(with more organic shapes drawings) through cameras. Fiducial IDs can be captured by any cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube that we play-locate on the grid has a unique \u201cFiducial ID\u201don it, and this gives it a parameter on the Z axis to help to form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, as camera detects the cubes on the grid and let the user to move them freely on it, we also needed to program the Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots(6x6) in order to frame design area and make the post-digitalization process easier. Through that process we had lots of problems: we couldn\u2019t solve the problem of the camera detecting the fiducials repeatedly. This process creates a lot of trash on the system and at the end we decided to reset the system as a solution to that problem. Beside the digitalization, we also worked a lot on the physical object. Firstly, we 3D printed the cubes which made of two parts and use 6 magnets in it. But, this method was not appropriate because it took 3 hours for each cube. So we ended up with the idea to build the cubes made of wood and we had to insert the magnets on surfaces. As we had sphere shape magnets, it was a real concern to be able to insert the magnets in the right magnetic directions. We designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet to eliminate that problem and we 3D printed them from raisin. Sphere shape magnets can move in the nest and find their magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we tried to raster the fudicials on cubes with laser cutter but the camera didn\u2019t detect it. Thus, we engraved the outlines and drew by hand at the end. We couldn\u2019t use vinyl because vinyl does not stick on the wood properly. Moreover, we had more trouble to cut the cubes out of the oak block. The block was 33 mm thick and we had to carve the surface 3mm to get 30mm thickness. We did that with the help of Adai and Edu. Through that process we discovered the facing function of the RhinoCam-CNC which provides the carving function with the end-mill has 30mm diameter. The other problem was to use the material efficiently: in order to eliminate material loss in CNC Adai made me to cut the cubes ( as we needed a lot of cubes) with the manual saw which needs a lot of attention and physical job. After engraving the fiducials in laser cutter we cut the cubes with manual saw and we drilled each surfaces (again) manually in order to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we used the CNC machine to build the grid out of plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic in order to build a structure to hold camera above the grid. That structure was designed in order to be located in different positions on the grid to get the right frame and capture the cubes clearly. Mostly we used the grasshopper for digitalization process. But, we also added the arduino in order to use the firefly plug-in and we also added a button to arduino in order to capture the desired design and to build that with the 3D printer. Personal note: As the challenges has to be done by groups, at a certain point projects become complicated and at that point most of the tasks has to be done by different colleagues. So normally, because of the need of using the time efficiently, each one ends up with working on the field that he/she has more experience. This ends with the lack of opportunity to improve some other skills. In short, I want to say that I prefer to have more classes on coding like the one that Oscar gave. During each challenge I was not able to improve my coding skills because as I am a maker I had to work on the machines and 3d modeling. And also we didn\u2019t have time to stay and worked-discover-learn from my classmates. To sum up, I have doubts about the efficiency of challenges. I cannot say that I didn\u2019t discover or learn anything, but I really prefer to have more time and opportunity to have more confidence in coding. But, challenge weeks are so intense and do not let me to discover-learn the coding neither from instructors nor colleagues.

As we took some tile decoration samples photos and we also worked on the various patterns options on 2D softwares. We used Illustrator and Inkscape to generate some patterns. To sum up, the grid board building process was a good experience to use the laser cutter after designing that on Rhinoceros and worked on the technical details to get the best results with the magnets we had to locate on the grid. The final result can be improved by using a thinner and mat acrylic and also by using smaller magnets. This will prevent the shades during the photo-digitalisation process and improve the quality of the edges of the tile decorations. Additionally, building it double size will provide all geometric shapes which helps to build the tile decoration completely stable on the grid. As a development plan; we can continue with 3D options but, we are not sure about how to integrate electronics on our project to develop for the next stages.

I downloaded the file from \u201cthingiverse.com\u201d and I discovered that the file has some specifications to help-support the printing process; as if it needs support for being built\u2026 After exported the file in .stl format, I opened that in Ultimaker-Cura and slice it. Surprisingly, 3D printing process with filaments is easier than 3D printing process of clay. When we tried to print some water brick samples made of clay by 3D printing, we had to make 4-5 tests for nozzle distance and speed in order to get the best results. But, I guess as filaments are more stable material, it was fast and easy to get the results. Furthermore, I wanted to print the model by the white filament to use it efficiently during the digital 3D scanning process, but as the white filament spool was heavy, I ended up using the black filament. As I was expecting the black filament effected the process of the digital scanning in a negative way. I was not able to scan the shark with scanner. I tried to scan a asthma-spray pump. Unfortunately, there are some missing surfaces on it. I also tried to scan the bust as it is completely white and less surfaces towards the ground. The result was neither a success, nor a disaster. As long as it hasn\u2019t a complicated organic shape, I prefer to 3D model the object rather than 3D scanning. 3D Shark with joints by caglaralkan","title":"Class Task No:5"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#class-task-no6","text":"Networking class with Victor was an introduction for creating network by using the Arduino software and local server.

First of all, we needed to download PunSubClient library and we had to connect to the local network by changing the Wifi name and password on the code. Then, we also had to modify the mqttClientuser (Victor), topicToSub and mqttClientName(our team name). Actually, apart from those, Marielle changed some lines on the code but I couldn\u2019t catch those parts.

I don\u2019t know if its Oscars talent but somehow he was able to explain so many thing about the coding language. At least I was able to catch the steps during the class even some difficulties happened. Oscar tried to move us forward in terms of networking through Arduino from the point that Victor started last week. Surprisingly, this was the best organized hands on learning session of the semester. We went through several steps; just by building a basic LED circuit we started with a \u201cblink\u201d command, and we tried to connected to a network and comment on a LED through an online dashboard.

As I already knew the thickness of the plywood(15mm), I decided to build an interlocking bed-side table. After modeling the piece, I thought on the modifications on drawing which is necessary for the CNC cutting. As I had decided to use 6mm end-mill, I modified the inner and outer corners of the pieces accordingly. It took more time than I expected. I booked the CNC machine for 11 a.m and arrived at 10 a.m in order to prepare the file for RhinoCam, but it took two and a half hours to start. Beside the preparation of the drawings, there are a lot of parameters that we need to modify for cutting and pocketing. I worked with Josep and he suggested to use \u201cpocketing\u201d function to cut small holes for safety reason to prevent any accident. We also defined the screws as the first cut(work piece). I decided to use 2 different 6mm end-mills for cutting. (6mm ball for pocketing and 6mm flat for cutting) Finishing up the work at Rhino-Cam, we located the 2440X1220mm plywood on the CNC machine. The next step was defining the x-y-z for the machine. For X and Y we used our eye and for Z we used the small button attached to the CNC. The first cut was for the screws. After, applying the screws manually, the pocketing started and we needed to change the end-mill to flat for the final cutting. I made a mistake in the design and had to cut an extra piece. And during that process we made another mistake on the surface and location of the workpiece on Z coordinate. Fortunately, the work piece was over the surface and we did not had a big accident. The following steps was sanding and assembling the pieces. Unexpectedly, sanding the edges and surfaces took so much time. But, at the end I felt satisfy with the result. Building a Bedside Table by CNC cutting by caglaralkan","title":"Class Task No:8"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#challenge-no2","text":"We decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we designed during the challenge-1. We mostly wanted to focus on digitalization process in order to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from 2D to 3D as one of the goal that we set before. In other words, it become a playground to discover 3d fabrication which is a bridge between a physical object and digital representative, more than a tile decorating kit. We had some reference projects to help us: MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table, and Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI (Reactable). At the end we had to simplify or goals because of the time limitation. As it is a project connects the physical and digital, it has a lot of details that needs to be solved. This time, we took the base-grid as a playground and decided to let people to play, change, combine the cubes that attached to it and positioned by magnets in order to build their unique design on the grid rather than 2D geometric shapes. We started with the digitalization process. We thought a lot on the process how to convert the physical items to digital representatives. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial id\u201d works like QR codes(with more organic shapes drawings) through cameras. Fiducial IDs can be captured by any cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube that we play-locate on the grid has a unique \u201cFiducial ID\u201don it, and this gives it a parameter on the Z axis to help to form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, as camera detects the cubes on the grid and let the user to move them freely on it, we also needed to program the Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots(6x6) in order to frame design area and make the post-digitalization process easier. Through that process we had lots of problems: we couldn\u2019t solve the problem of the camera detecting the fiducials repeatedly. This process creates a lot of trash on the system and at the end we decided to reset the system as a solution to that problem. Beside the digitalization, we also worked a lot on the physical object. Firstly, we 3D printed the cubes which made of two parts and use 6 magnets in it. But, this method was not appropriate because it took 3 hours for each cube. So we ended up with the idea to build the cubes made of wood and we had to insert the magnets on surfaces. As we had sphere shape magnets, it was a real concern to be able to insert the magnets in the right magnetic directions. We designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet to eliminate that problem and we 3D printed them from raisin. Sphere shape magnets can move in the nest and find their magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we tried to raster the fudicials on cubes with laser cutter but the camera didn\u2019t detect it. Thus, we engraved the outlines and drew by hand at the end. We couldn\u2019t use vinyl because vinyl does not stick on the wood properly. Moreover, we had more trouble to cut the cubes out of the oak block. The block was 33 mm thick and we had to carve the surface 3mm to get 30mm thickness. We did that with the help of Adai and Edu. Through that process we discovered the facing function of the RhinoCam-CNC which provides the carving function with the end-mill has 30mm diameter. The other problem was to use the material efficiently: in order to eliminate material loss in CNC Adai made me to cut the cubes ( as we needed a lot of cubes) with the manual saw which needs a lot of attention and physical job. After engraving the fiducials in laser cutter we cut the cubes with manual saw and we drilled each surfaces (again) manually in order to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we used the CNC machine to build the grid out of plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic in order to build a structure to hold camera above the grid. That structure was designed in order to be located in different positions on the grid to get the right frame and capture the cubes clearly. Mostly we used the grasshopper for digitalization process. But, we also added the arduino in order to use the firefly plug-in and we also added a button to arduino in order to capture the desired design and to build that with the 3D printer. Personal note: As the challenges has to be done by groups, at a certain point projects become complicated and at that point most of the tasks has to be done by different colleagues. So normally, because of the need of using the time efficiently, each one ends up with working on the field that he/she has more experience. This ends with the lack of opportunity to improve some other skills. In short, I want to say that I prefer to have more classes on coding like the one that Oscar gave. During each challenge I was not able to improve my coding skills because as I am a maker I had to work on the machines and 3d modeling. And also we didn\u2019t have time to stay and worked-discover-learn from my classmates. To sum up, I have doubts about the efficiency of challenges. I cannot say that I didn\u2019t discover or learn anything, but I really prefer to have more time and opportunity to have more confidence in coding. But, challenge weeks are so intense and do not let me to discover-learn the coding neither from instructors nor colleagues.

The world has changed rapidly in the last 40 years. I remember watching our first black and white television without a remote control, but now I can zip around the city on my mono-wheel without even taking a step. However, it\u2019s important to remember that many communities around the world still don\u2019t have access to basic technologies or even clean drinking water, which are essential for survival. The origin of the word \u2018design\u2019 comes from \u2018designare\u2019 in Latin, which means to draw a plan on paper. After architecture, the military, industry, technology, and philosophy, we started to use the word \u2018design\u2019 so often in daily life. I believe that the word \u2018design\u2019 that we talk about in daily life is mostly the outcome of the industrial revolution, used as an advertising agent to convince and motivate people to consume and buy a lot. Additionally, when we start to talk about today\u2019s tools, the first thing that comes to our minds is mostly about technology, which gives us the opportunity to communicate instantly, even with outer space. However, I am thinking about how accessible technology is and what all of these new technologies promise us. For instance; religions promise believers heaven, feudalism promised safety in resource and food cultivation, and capitalism promises social elevation. Any kind of alternatives should have some promises. What could new technologies and the alternative futures promise be? Are we looking forward to the day when we have personal robots that work instead of us, and will we be able to sail among the stars in total peace without worrying about anything? I will try to give some answers to three main questions with the help of todays tools and concept of design approaches. How design can reconfigure systems of extraction? Design has a significant power to challenge and reconfigure systems of extraction by questioning the dominant narratives of what is considered valuable and by considering the social and ecological implications of production and consumption. In the book \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d by Jason Moore, the author explains how the capitalist world system has relied on cheap nature, cheap labor, and cheap energy to fuel the growth of global capitalism. Design can challenge this by questioning the very concept of \u201ccheapness\u201d and reimagining what constitutes value in production and consumption. For example, design can prioritize the use of renewable resources, circular economies, and local sourcing to reduce the extraction of natural resources and the exploitation of labor. Here are some other ways in which design can help reconfigure systems of extraction at first glance: Redesigning products: Designers can help reduce the demand for extractive resources by creating products that are designed for longevity, repairability, and reuse. By designing products that can be easily disassembled and repaired, designers can reduce the need for new resource extraction. Material innovation: Designers can help reduce the environmental impact of resource extraction by developing new materials that are more sustainable and require fewer resources. For example, designers can develop plant-based alternatives to synthetic materials or create new composite materials that are more durable and require fewer resources to produce. Circular economy: Designers can help create a circular economy that minimizes waste and promotes resource efficiency. By designing products and systems that are designed for reuse and recycling, designers can help reduce the need for new resource extraction. Sustainable infrastructure: Designers can help create sustainable infrastructure that reduces the need for extractive resources. For example, designers can create buildings that generate their own energy, reduce water consumption, and minimize waste. Community engagement: Designers can work with local communities to identify their needs and develop solutions that are tailored to their unique circumstances. By engaging with communities that are directly impacted by extractive industries, designers can help create solutions that are more equitable and sustainable. To sum up, design has the potential to play a significant role in reconfiguring systems of extraction by promoting sustainable practices and reducing the environmental impact of resource extraction. Which worlds and futures can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? Today\u2019s tools, such as digital technology and advanced materials, provide designers with unprecedented capabilities to envision and create new worlds. In the book \u201cDesign as Participation\u201d by Kevin Slavin, the author argues that design has the power to shape our social and political realities. Design can be used to imagine and create new social, economic, and political systems that promote social justice, environmental sustainability, and human well-being which is the most important. For example, designers can use virtual and augmented reality to simulate new forms of urban planning or community engagement. They can use advanced materials to create sustainable and resilient infrastructure that responds to the challenges of climate change. I think that any system designed in advance or that grows over time eventually starts to behave like a living organism, searching for alternative ways to sustain itself. For example, the transition from feudalism to capitalism was facilitated by the production of sugar in Madeira. The island\u2019s forests were destroyed to cultivate sugarcane and use it as a fuel source. When the forests were depleted, new solutions were invented, such as cultivating grapes and supplying cheap wood from new markets. As Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore argue in the their book \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d, \u2018Suppose we consider capitalism as an illness; then, it is a disease that consumes your body and profits from selling your remains as fertilizer. The profits earned from selling the fertilizer are then invested in cultivating sugarcane and selling it to visitors who pay to see your grave.\u2019 Here are more examples of the worlds and futures that we can design with today\u2019s tools: Virtual Worlds: With the advancement of technology, we can now design and create virtual worlds that are incredibly realistic and immersive. These worlds can be used for entertainment, education, and even training. Augmented Reality Worlds: Augmented reality (AR) allows us to overlay digital content onto the real world. We can design AR worlds that enhance our surroundings, such as adding information to a museum exhibit or creating an interactive game in a park. 3D Printing Worlds: 3D printing technology has given us the power to create physical objects from digital designs. With 3D printing, we can design and create entire worlds, such as miniature models of cities or landscapes. Space Exploration Worlds: With the help of space exploration tools, we can design and explore worlds beyond our own. We can use telescopes, rovers, and other tools to explore other planets, moons, and even asteroids. Artificial Intelligence Worlds: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to create intelligent agents that can interact with their environment. With AI, we can design and create worlds where these agents can learn and evolve, such as in simulation environments or video games. Human well-being worlds: Design can be used to create a human well-being future with today\u2019s tools by focusing on designing with and for people, rather than simply designing for profit or aesthetics. As Kevin Slavin called this approach \u201cDesign as Participation\u201d, involves actively involving people in the design process and empowering them to shape the products and services that affect their lives. According to Slavin, \u201cDesign as Participation is a way of working that acknowledges and responds to the reality of an interconnected world, where the inputs and outputs of a design are entangled with everything else.\u201d This means that designers must consider the broader social, economic, and environmental impact of their designs, and actively engage with the communities they are designing for. One example of Design as Participation in action is the \u201cTrash Track\u201d project, which was created by the MIT Sensible City Lab. This project used GPS-enabled devices to track the movement of trash through the city, allowing people to better understand the environmental impact of their waste and make more informed decisions about their consumption habits. By involving people in the design process and using technology to create more transparent and participatory systems, Design as Participation has the potential to create a more sustainable, equitable, and human-centered future. In conclusion, with the power of today\u2019s tools, we can design and create a wide range of worlds limited only by our creativity and imagination. Unfortunately, the capacity of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201ctodays tools\u201d that we know and talk about today is not only a result of systems such as capitalism, feudalism, and technology, but is also largely a product of the Industrial Revolution. While the concept of design may have no limit, our personal imaginations and creativity do have limits. Perhaps the concept of a collective-collaborative minds work better in terms of creativity and has more capacity and tools. On the other hand, technology, which is supposed to serve people, causes, supports, and makes every single person on the planet live, act, and behave more individually. In other words, I am doubtful about the role and power of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201c\u201dtodays tools\u201d in terms of alternative ways of living, which are supposed to be better. How can we design the transition towards these worlds and futures? Designing the transition towards more sustainable and just worlds requires a shift from traditional design approaches that focus on products and services to participatory design approaches that engage diverse stakeholders in the design process. In the book \u201cSteps to an Ecology of Mind\u201d by Gregory Bateson, the author argues that the key to creating more sustainable and resilient systems is to focus on the relationships between different elements and actors in the system. Design can facilitate this by engaging diverse stakeholders in the design process, including marginalized communities, workers, and environmental groups. By involving these groups, designers can create more inclusive and equitable systems that respond to the needs and aspirations of all members of society. Moreover, to design a transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a deliberate and strategic approach. Here are some steps that can help facilitate the transition: Set clear goals: To design a transition towards the desired future, we must first establish clear goals and objectives. These goals should be specific, measurable, and actionable, and should reflect the vision for the future. Collaborate: Achieving the desired future will require collaboration across different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals. Collaboration should be fostered through partnerships, co-creation, and open dialogue. Experiment and Prototype: The design of the transition should be iterative, with experiments and prototypes testing and refining ideas before scaling. This approach will allow us to learn from failures and successes, and adjust course as needed. Enable Policy Frameworks: Governments and other policymakers should create the enabling policy frameworks to support the transition. This could include regulations, incentives, and other policy tools to promote sustainable development, social inclusion, and technological innovation. Invest in Innovation: To facilitate the transition, there is a need for investment in innovation and research and development. This could include investments in new technologies, business models, and social innovations that support the desired future. Empower Local Communities: Local communities play a critical role in the transition towards the desired future. Empowering them to participate in the design and implementation of the transition will help to ensure that the transition is inclusive and equitable. As a result, designing the transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a collaborative and inclusive approach, with a focus on experimentation, innovation, and policy frameworks that support the transition. Personal Note; Cash is king, and capital is power, but what was the source of power before that? Physical power? Success? Heritage? There are various sources of power, including physical power for protection and defense, communal power for protection of family, tribe and land, religious power, financial power, resource power, and information-technology power. In all cases, demand and supply also play a key role. What about the power of colonialism? While we criticize the colonial attempts of Europe, many people around the world are trying to obtain a passport from the European Union today. What is the motivation behind that? I believe that, more than the American dream of becoming rich easily, the main motivation and need of human beings is safety. People feel safer within the borders of the European Union than anywhere else. Maybe, first of all it is better to analyze the source of that feeling of safety within the European Union.

Unfortunately, the capacity of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201ctodays tools\u201d that we know and talk about today is not only a result of systems such as capitalism, feudalism, and technology, but is also largely a product of the Industrial Revolution. While the concept of design may have no limit, our personal imaginations and creativity do have limits. Perhaps the concept of a collective-collaborative minds work better in terms of creativity and has more capacity and tools. On the other hand, technology, which is supposed to serve people, causes, supports, and makes every single person on the planet live, act, and behave more individually. In other words, I am doubtful about the role and power of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201c\u201dtodays tools\u201d in terms of alternative ways of living, which are supposed to be better. How can we design the transition towards these worlds and futures? Designing the transition towards more sustainable and just worlds requires a shift from traditional design approaches that focus on products and services to participatory design approaches that engage diverse stakeholders in the design process. In the book \u201cSteps to an Ecology of Mind\u201d by Gregory Bateson, the author argues that the key to creating more sustainable and resilient systems is to focus on the relationships between different elements and actors in the system. Design can facilitate this by engaging diverse stakeholders in the design process, including marginalized communities, workers, and environmental groups. By involving these groups, designers can create more inclusive and equitable systems that respond to the needs and aspirations of all members of society. Moreover, to design a transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a deliberate and strategic approach. Here are some steps that can help facilitate the transition: Set clear goals: To design a transition towards the desired future, we must first establish clear goals and objectives. These goals should be specific, measurable, and actionable, and should reflect the vision for the future. Collaborate: Achieving the desired future will require collaboration across different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals. Collaboration should be fostered through partnerships, co-creation, and open dialogue. Experiment and Prototype: The design of the transition should be iterative, with experiments and prototypes testing and refining ideas before scaling. This approach will allow us to learn from failures and successes, and adjust course as needed. Enable Policy Frameworks: Governments and other policymakers should create the enabling policy frameworks to support the transition. This could include regulations, incentives, and other policy tools to promote sustainable development, social inclusion, and technological innovation. Invest in Innovation: To facilitate the transition, there is a need for investment in innovation and research and development. This could include investments in new technologies, business models, and social innovations that support the desired future. Empower Local Communities: Local communities play a critical role in the transition towards the desired future. Empowering them to participate in the design and implementation of the transition will help to ensure that the transition is inclusive and equitable. As a result, designing the transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a collaborative and inclusive approach, with a focus on experimentation, innovation, and policy frameworks that support the transition. Personal Note; Cash is king, and capital is power, but what was the source of power before that? Physical power? Success? Heritage? There are various sources of power, including physical power for protection and defense, communal power for protection of family, tribe and land, religious power, financial power, resource power, and information-technology power. In all cases, demand and supply also play a key role. What about the power of colonialism? While we criticize the colonial attempts of Europe, many people around the world are trying to obtain a passport from the European Union today. What is the motivation behind that? I believe that, more than the American dream of becoming rich easily, the main motivation and need of human beings is safety. People feel safer within the borders of the European Union than anywhere else. Maybe, first of all it is better to analyze the source of that feeling of safety within the European Union.

Specifically, the organization \u2018Caixa d\u2019Eines y Feines\u2019 strives to contribute to and support individuals who are curious about becoming makers, not only by providing them with equipment but also by organizing workshops and facilitating gatherings to encourage sharing of experiences. In my opinion, these gatherings are the first steps in building communities. Firstly, the main idea is \u201cdemocratization and accessibility of production\u201d which can be done by hacking the monopoly on production/manufacturing. At this point it is compulsory to support DIY projects by easily accessible equipment, materials and alternatives making-production methods. Additionally, I made some searches on the concept of transformation of the personal and collective working spaces into places to support the idea of urban productivity. Growing something -urban farming- or recycle/up-cycle materials and resources (especially water) cardboard, wood, metals\u2026 And generating projects to use those resources efficiently. \u201cSocial making - A collective open-ending recipe-manual concept\u201d Secondly, I noticed that there is not a single way of doing something. There are always various possible ways of building anything with different tools and materials. Moreover, every single person does not have access to every material and tool all the time. So a platform can be built to share all of those information about production and material alternatives. We can call this \u201ca play ground\u201d for curious, productive and maker-partaker communities. By the help of this platform makers can share their own recipes, manuals, formulas, equipments, materials, time, labor, power, patience, experiences, clues, styles. As individual makers have the opportunity to come together and share their experiences, the maker communities and the idea of individual productivity will gain power and this would support the alternative futures concept which might grow different than the monopoly of industry and supply chain. We can also call this supporting low tech lifestyle \u2013 which is more sustainable \u2013 or living with less vs producing with less. To sum up, I focused on to dream, support and create alternative urban futures which are more sustainable and individually and communally productive. The main purpose of these alternative futures is to offer alternatives to existing supply chains which provides so much to mediators rather than local producers. Potential questions that I need to ask myself at this point: How meaningful these ideas for others? How to include others to interested and collaborate with you? How to contribute-develop your ideas? Chapter 6: Experimentations and Interventions \u00b6 We started the second term with a general review of our personal/collective projects and the related interventions that we had made during the first semester. During the first session, we tried to find new collaboration opportunities in order to continue our interventions and make them as meaningful as possible. At the end of the first session, I came up with the idea of participating in two main project groups in order to narrow down the wide scope of DIY projects and focus on certain concepts in detail. In the first group, we decided to work on DIY projects related to gray water storage and reuse in domestic spaces. Suddenly, the project group became crowded, and we decided to create sections within the \u2018water group\u2019 and name the potential areas to explore. Based on participants\u2019 areas of interest, each individual continued to work and conduct research in their respective field or fields. The potential areas of interest that concerned my interventions were: Brick Design (Geometry, Structure, Strength, Size) - Slip Casting and Connecting Clay Pieces Leak-free (Working with clay for our purposes) - Identifying Possible Communities to Interact with (Researching and generating ideas on who to involve and how) - and Filtering. Collective Design Space(Water People) \u201cI had previously experienced collecting gray water for a project, and by the third day, I had run out of containers. The main motivation for me to join the water group is to develop a DIY project that provides an easy way to store gray water in domestic spaces. The design of a \u2018water brick\u2019 could be a potential solution for storing gray water, and this concept could evolve into an architectural or constructional item that enables the reuse of gray water for secondary purposes. While this concept can be seen as a final product, there are several steps involved in reaching that ultimate outcome. Below is a table that shows the average daily production of gray water and black water for an individual person.\u201d During my first researches, I figured out that in any cases gray water has to be filtered before stored. Not only for bad smell and preventing the growth of bacterias and microbes in the grey water, but also keep the reservoir clean and long lasting. There are many ways and materials exist to filter different types of water. The most common method is using the rocks-gravel, sand and charcoal materials for filtration. Charcoal is the most common and accessible material to get rid of chemicals and bacterials whereas the sand and rocks-gravel used for bigger particles separation and physical filtration. Rocks-gravel and sand has to be cleaned yearly and charcoal needs to be replaced every two years. I reached these valuable informations through an organization \u201cAqueous Solutions\u201d which works to promote livelihood security, environmental and economic sustainability, and local self-reliance through ecological design and appropriate technologies in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) ( www.aqsolutions.org ). The organization have many experience on the field and they explain the system clearly for different scales. I collaborated with Josephine Bourghardt in order to built a small scale sand-gravel-carhoal filter and test if it works properly. We used the fab-lab and bought same material and succeeded to build and test it. Furthermore, there are other methods and materials available for filtering water for both first and second use. Ceramic filtration is widely used due to its porous structure, which allows water to flow while retaining micro particles. Ultraviolet filtration and reverse osmosis are other popular methods, but they can be quite complex for potential DIY projects. Additionally, Jonathan encouraged us to conduct further research on lipid separation, which is another form of physical filtration, prior to chemical filtration. Lipids can be up-cycled as soap or used to cultivate certain plants. Grey water needs to pass through a physical separator to retain the lipids in specific sections based on density differences. Ramiro, Korbi and I worked on a lipid separator and we tested that. (they continued to work on that separator during the third term) On the other hand, as a second project and intervention group with Marc and Ahmed we agreed on exploring ways to combine digital and physical tools to support DIY projects. As there is a strict boarder between digital worlds and physical representations, it is quite difficult to destroy the bias of how difficult to learn, use and integrate digital tools to generate DIY projects. However they look so complicated and hard to learn and use, digitals tools give us a lot of personalization and customization opportunities to modify any project. As those two terms -personalization and customization- are two important key words for DIY projects, democratization of the digital tools is essential. During the second term with Ahmed and Marc we tried to develop a concept that combine the physical and digital worlds. We took the parametric design as a base and tried to create a base project which provides an environment to make the digital fabrication tools accessible and easy to understand. Collective Intervention no:4 \u00b6 As a group, after discussing about our common interest and as we want to work on water bricks to store domestic grey water, we decided to work on something related to modularity, interchangeability, parametric design, personalization-customization of a product\u2026 We ended up with the idea of building a DIY toolkit which provides designing unique tile decorations and patterns made of those. We also took that opportunity as a first step to connect the digital and physical. Firstly, we talked on 3D and 2D options and then we decided to focus on 2D option. For a simple tile decoration we need vinyl designs which needs to be sticked on stencil frame to transfer the ceramic ink. Instead of providing ready to use patterns, stickers, vinyls we preferred to work on a grid board and some geometric shapes which provides the user to make their own unique design. Tile-Deco is a concept that consists of a grid made of acrylic and magnets. The grid is designed to hold geometric pieces, which can be attached to the grid using magnets, allowing for the creation of various tile decorations. During the design process of the grid board, we aimed to minimize shades and reflections that could negatively impact the quality of the photo-digitalization process of the vinyl. However, due to the defined thickness of the acrylic and sizes of the magnets, it was not possible to completely eliminate these issues. Nevertheless, we covered the acrylic surfaces with a matte vinyl to reduce reflections and enhance the quality of the photo-digitalization process. While the transfer of the vinyl onto the grid board was challenging and required multiple attempts, we finally achieved a satisfactory design with the third vinyl application. Another problem we encountered was the instability of some geometric pieces used to generate the tile decoration design. Some of these pieces had only a single magnet, causing them to be unstable on the grid. During the presentation, a constructive criticism suggested doubling the size of the grid board to address this problem, which could indeed be a perfect solution. The next step involved aligning the patterns with the photo-digitalization process. We took photos of various tile decoration samples and worked on different pattern options using software such as Illustrator and Inkscape. In summary, the process of building the grid board was a valuable experience, involving the use of a laser cutter after designing it on Rhinoceros and working on technical details to achieve the best results with the magnets on the grid. To improve the final result, it would be beneficial to use a thinner and matte acrylic and smaller magnets. This would help prevent shades during the photo-digitalization process and enhance the quality of the tile decoration edges. Furthermore, doubling the size of the grid board would ensure stability for all geometric shapes in building the tile decoration. During our discussions in the MDEF group, we received valuable feedback on our first prototype. Initially, some colleagues found the digitalization process unnecessary and difficult to apply. However, after explaining our main goal of customization, their perception changed. I realized that our project was too focused on a specific end product, such as a tile, which made it challenging to fully explore and experience the connection and transition between the physical and digital worlds and tools. As a development plan, we could explore 3D options, but we are uncertain about how to integrate other digital fabrication tools into our project for future stages and make it more useful beyond being open-source. It is important to note that even if a product or concept is open-source, it does not guarantee easy replication or application. Additionally, it would be beneficial to shift the focus towards the process of connecting the digital and physical worlds and tools, rather than solely on the end product. Reference Projects as Inspiration Collective Intervention no:5 \u00b6 Ahmed, Marc, and I decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we had designed during the previous intervention. Our main focus was on the digitalization process, aiming to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from a 2D to a 3D experience, which was one of our initial goals. In other words, we wanted it to become more than just a tile decorating kit and serve as a playground to explore other digital and 3D fabrication tools as a bridge between physical objects and digital representation. To help us with the project, we looked into reference projects such as MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table and Reactable\u2019s Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI. However, due to time limitations, we had to simplify our goals. Given that this project involves the connection of the physical and digital worlds, there were numerous details that needed to be addressed. This time, we decided to use the base-grid as a playground and allow people to play, change, and combine cubes attached to it using magnets, enabling them to build their unique designs on the grid rather than relying on predefined 2D geometric shapes. We named this project \u201cPixel Cubes\u201d. We started by working on the digitalization process. We put a lot of thought into how to convert the physical items into digital representations. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial ID\u201d that functions similarly to QR codes but with more organic shape drawings. Fiducial IDs can be captured by cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube placed on the grid has a unique fiducial ID, which provides a parameter on the Z-axis (height) to help form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, while the camera detects the cubes on the grid and allows users to move them freely, we also needed to program Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots (6x6) to frame the design area and simplify the post-digitalization process. Throughout this process, we encountered many issues, such as repetitive fiducial detection by the camera, resulting in system clutter. To address this problem, we decided to implement a system reset as a solution. In addition to the digitalization aspect, we put a lot of effort into the physical objects. Initially, we 3D printed the cubes using two parts and included six magnets. However, this method was not suitable as it took three hours for each cube. Eventually, we came up with the idea of using wood to build the cubes and inserted the magnets onto the surfaces. Since we had spherical magnets, it was crucial to insert them in the correct magnetic directions. To solve this problem, we designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet, which eliminated the issue. We 3D printed the nests using resin, allowing the spherical magnets to move and align themselves with the magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we attempted to engrave the fiducials on the cubes using a laser cutter, but the camera did not detect them. As a result, we engraved the outlines and hand-drew the fiducials. Vinyl was not suitable for use on wood as it did not stick properly. Moreover, we encountered difficulties in cutting the cubes out of the oak block. The block was initially 33 mm thick, and we needed to carve it to achieve a 30 mm thickness. With the assistance of Adai and Edu, we managed to carve the surface using the facing function of RhinoCam-CNC, which provided the carving function with an end-mill of 30 mm diameter. Efficient use of the material posed another challenge. To minimize material loss in the CNC process, Adai helped me cut the cubes manually using a saw, which required great attention and physical effort. After engraving the fiducials with the laser cutter, we cut the cubes using a manual saw and manually drilled each surface to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we utilized the CNC machine to construct the grid using plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic to create a structure that held the camera above the grid. This structure was designed to be positioned at different locations on the grid to capture the cubes clearly and frame the design appropriately. We primarily used Grasshopper for the digitalization process. However, we also integrated Arduino to utilize the firefly plug-in and added a button to capture the desired design and build it using the 3D printer. Chapter 7: Updated Vision and Identity \u00b6 Overall, we had the chance to show, test and get feedbacks about Pixel Cubes during Design Dialogues II. Mostly, our guests found the idea quite interesting and helpful as a bridge between physical and digital worlds. As we tried to explain our main goal -which supporting the maker spaces and DIY project by making digital tools accessible and easy to use- our intervention made more sense. Most helpful comments and feedbacks and questions were; - Able to model or 3d print without 3d model skills, - What will be the next step to explore, - Simplify digital and physical processes - Human machine interface Which combine the physical and digital worlds - Focusing on loops-gaps between two worlds and let the digital fabrication processes less complicated - Short cuts; Can visually impaired people design by the help of this concept - Can we simplify and make accessible design processes for everyone - It\u2019s better to recognize the fiducials in the physical world to have the sense According to my fight and my vision my alternative present can be defined like this; \u201cCitizens that interested in making and DIY projects but don\u2019t have experience and courage on digital fabrication to develop advanced projects, now have the opportunity to discover the link between physical and digital worlds\u201d As an updated vision and development plan we need to test our concept within some communities like \u201cCaixa d\u2019Eines y Feines\u201d which supports maker space movements and provides tools and workshops to individuals.","title":"Design Studio II"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#design-studio-ii","text":"Design Studio II","title":"Design Studio II"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#chapter-5-reframing-of-the-project","text":"Overview to lead the path for next stages; Creating Values / Urban productivity practices So far, I have tried to focus on potential collaborations and interventions in order to come together with communities that support maker spaces and urban productivity practices.

Suddenly, the project group became crowded, and we decided to create sections within the \u2018water group\u2019 and name the potential areas to explore. Based on participants\u2019 areas of interest, each individual continued to work and conduct research in their respective field or fields. The potential areas of interest that concerned my interventions were: Brick Design (Geometry, Structure, Strength, Size) - Slip Casting and Connecting Clay Pieces Leak-free (Working with clay for our purposes) - Identifying Possible Communities to Interact with (Researching and generating ideas on who to involve and how) - and Filtering. Collective Design Space(Water People) \u201cI had previously experienced collecting gray water for a project, and by the third day, I had run out of containers. The main motivation for me to join the water group is to develop a DIY project that provides an easy way to store gray water in domestic spaces. The design of a \u2018water brick\u2019 could be a potential solution for storing gray water, and this concept could evolve into an architectural or constructional item that enables the reuse of gray water for secondary purposes. While this concept can be seen as a final product, there are several steps involved in reaching that ultimate outcome. Below is a table that shows the average daily production of gray water and black water for an individual person.\u201d During my first researches, I figured out that in any cases gray water has to be filtered before stored. Not only for bad smell and preventing the growth of bacterias and microbes in the grey water, but also keep the reservoir clean and long lasting. There are many ways and materials exist to filter different types of water. The most common method is using the rocks-gravel, sand and charcoal materials for filtration. Charcoal is the most common and accessible material to get rid of chemicals and bacterials whereas the sand and rocks-gravel used for bigger particles separation and physical filtration. Rocks-gravel and sand has to be cleaned yearly and charcoal needs to be replaced every two years. I reached these valuable informations through an organization \u201cAqueous Solutions\u201d which works to promote livelihood security, environmental and economic sustainability, and local self-reliance through ecological design and appropriate technologies in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) ( www.aqsolutions.org ). The organization have many experience on the field and they explain the system clearly for different scales. I collaborated with Josephine Bourghardt in order to built a small scale sand-gravel-carhoal filter and test if it works properly. We used the fab-lab and bought same material and succeeded to build and test it. Furthermore, there are other methods and materials available for filtering water for both first and second use. Ceramic filtration is widely used due to its porous structure, which allows water to flow while retaining micro particles. Ultraviolet filtration and reverse osmosis are other popular methods, but they can be quite complex for potential DIY projects. Additionally, Jonathan encouraged us to conduct further research on lipid separation, which is another form of physical filtration, prior to chemical filtration. Lipids can be up-cycled as soap or used to cultivate certain plants. Grey water needs to pass through a physical separator to retain the lipids in specific sections based on density differences. Ramiro, Korbi and I worked on a lipid separator and we tested that. (they continued to work on that separator during the third term) On the other hand, as a second project and intervention group with Marc and Ahmed we agreed on exploring ways to combine digital and physical tools to support DIY projects. As there is a strict boarder between digital worlds and physical representations, it is quite difficult to destroy the bias of how difficult to learn, use and integrate digital tools to generate DIY projects. However they look so complicated and hard to learn and use, digitals tools give us a lot of personalization and customization opportunities to modify any project. As those two terms -personalization and customization- are two important key words for DIY projects, democratization of the digital tools is essential. During the second term with Ahmed and Marc we tried to develop a concept that combine the physical and digital worlds. We took the parametric design as a base and tried to create a base project which provides an environment to make the digital fabrication tools accessible and easy to understand.","title":"Chapter 6: Experimentations and Interventions"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#collective-intervention-no4","text":"As a group, after discussing about our common interest and as we want to work on water bricks to store domestic grey water, we decided to work on something related to modularity, interchangeability, parametric design, personalization-customization of a product\u2026 We ended up with the idea of building a DIY toolkit which provides designing unique tile decorations and patterns made of those. We also took that opportunity as a first step to connect the digital and physical. Firstly, we talked on 3D and 2D options and then we decided to focus on 2D option. For a simple tile decoration we need vinyl designs which needs to be sticked on stencil frame to transfer the ceramic ink. Instead of providing ready to use patterns, stickers, vinyls we preferred to work on a grid board and some geometric shapes which provides the user to make their own unique design. Tile-Deco is a concept that consists of a grid made of acrylic and magnets. The grid is designed to hold geometric pieces, which can be attached to the grid using magnets, allowing for the creation of various tile decorations. During the design process of the grid board, we aimed to minimize shades and reflections that could negatively impact the quality of the photo-digitalization process of the vinyl. However, due to the defined thickness of the acrylic and sizes of the magnets, it was not possible to completely eliminate these issues. Nevertheless, we covered the acrylic surfaces with a matte vinyl to reduce reflections and enhance the quality of the photo-digitalization process. While the transfer of the vinyl onto the grid board was challenging and required multiple attempts, we finally achieved a satisfactory design with the third vinyl application. Another problem we encountered was the instability of some geometric pieces used to generate the tile decoration design. Some of these pieces had only a single magnet, causing them to be unstable on the grid. During the presentation, a constructive criticism suggested doubling the size of the grid board to address this problem, which could indeed be a perfect solution. The next step involved aligning the patterns with the photo-digitalization process. We took photos of various tile decoration samples and worked on different pattern options using software such as Illustrator and Inkscape. In summary, the process of building the grid board was a valuable experience, involving the use of a laser cutter after designing it on Rhinoceros and working on technical details to achieve the best results with the magnets on the grid. To improve the final result, it would be beneficial to use a thinner and matte acrylic and smaller magnets. This would help prevent shades during the photo-digitalization process and enhance the quality of the tile decoration edges. Furthermore, doubling the size of the grid board would ensure stability for all geometric shapes in building the tile decoration. During our discussions in the MDEF group, we received valuable feedback on our first prototype. Initially, some colleagues found the digitalization process unnecessary and difficult to apply. However, after explaining our main goal of customization, their perception changed. I realized that our project was too focused on a specific end product, such as a tile, which made it challenging to fully explore and experience the connection and transition between the physical and digital worlds and tools. As a development plan, we could explore 3D options, but we are uncertain about how to integrate other digital fabrication tools into our project for future stages and make it more useful beyond being open-source. It is important to note that even if a product or concept is open-source, it does not guarantee easy replication or application. Additionally, it would be beneficial to shift the focus towards the process of connecting the digital and physical worlds and tools, rather than solely on the end product. Reference Projects as Inspiration","title":"Collective Intervention no:4"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#collective-intervention-no5","text":"Ahmed, Marc, and I decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we had designed during the previous intervention. Our main focus was on the digitalization process, aiming to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from a 2D to a 3D experience, which was one of our initial goals. In other words, we wanted it to become more than just a tile decorating kit and serve as a playground to explore other digital and 3D fabrication tools as a bridge between physical objects and digital representation. To help us with the project, we looked into reference projects such as MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table and Reactable\u2019s Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI. However, due to time limitations, we had to simplify our goals. Given that this project involves the connection of the physical and digital worlds, there were numerous details that needed to be addressed. This time, we decided to use the base-grid as a playground and allow people to play, change, and combine cubes attached to it using magnets, enabling them to build their unique designs on the grid rather than relying on predefined 2D geometric shapes. We named this project \u201cPixel Cubes\u201d. We started by working on the digitalization process. We put a lot of thought into how to convert the physical items into digital representations. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial ID\u201d that functions similarly to QR codes but with more organic shape drawings. Fiducial IDs can be captured by cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube placed on the grid has a unique fiducial ID, which provides a parameter on the Z-axis (height) to help form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, while the camera detects the cubes on the grid and allows users to move them freely, we also needed to program Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots (6x6) to frame the design area and simplify the post-digitalization process. Throughout this process, we encountered many issues, such as repetitive fiducial detection by the camera, resulting in system clutter. To address this problem, we decided to implement a system reset as a solution. In addition to the digitalization aspect, we put a lot of effort into the physical objects. Initially, we 3D printed the cubes using two parts and included six magnets. However, this method was not suitable as it took three hours for each cube. Eventually, we came up with the idea of using wood to build the cubes and inserted the magnets onto the surfaces. Since we had spherical magnets, it was crucial to insert them in the correct magnetic directions. To solve this problem, we designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet, which eliminated the issue. We 3D printed the nests using resin, allowing the spherical magnets to move and align themselves with the magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we attempted to engrave the fiducials on the cubes using a laser cutter, but the camera did not detect them. As a result, we engraved the outlines and hand-drew the fiducials. Vinyl was not suitable for use on wood as it did not stick properly. Moreover, we encountered difficulties in cutting the cubes out of the oak block. The block was initially 33 mm thick, and we needed to carve it to achieve a 30 mm thickness. With the assistance of Adai and Edu, we managed to carve the surface using the facing function of RhinoCam-CNC, which provided the carving function with an end-mill of 30 mm diameter. Efficient use of the material posed another challenge. To minimize material loss in the CNC process, Adai helped me cut the cubes manually using a saw, which required great attention and physical effort. After engraving the fiducials with the laser cutter, we cut the cubes using a manual saw and manually drilled each surface to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we utilized the CNC machine to construct the grid using plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic to create a structure that held the camera above the grid. This structure was designed to be positioned at different locations on the grid to capture the cubes clearly and frame the design appropriately. We primarily used Grasshopper for the digitalization process. However, we also integrated Arduino to utilize the firefly plug-in and added a button to capture the desired design and build it using the 3D printer.","title":"Collective Intervention no:5"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#chapter-7-updated-vision-and-identity","text":"Overall, we had the chance to show, test and get feedbacks about Pixel Cubes during Design Dialogues II.

The advantages of utilizing a robotic arm compared to other manufacturing methods lie in its flexibility across multiple axes. I can say that it resembles a CNC machine, but certainly it offers additional possibilities like antigravity printing. We tried to explore Grasshopper to comprehend how to generate simulations and experimented with scripts to observe how we could control and modify the parameters. When constructing a path to connect points together, we can determine a curved joint instead of a straight line. This curved path, known as a spline, should be converted to include the corresponding plane for each point.

Through Hydra, we gained the ability to modify existing visuals, write code from scratch, incorporate our own cameras, and even control the visuals using sound inputs. As someone without a coding background, this experience proved immensely beneficial in comprehending how each command affected the visuals and their parameters. It provided valuable insights into the direct relationship between coding commands and the endless possibilities that these tools offer for creative expression. The most entertaining and interesting part was to try to work with the microphones of our computers can be used as an input to get some outcomes. It was quite nice to learn a bit the coding language again. Design by caglaralkan Blender Introduction and Blender Interface with Arduino \u00b6 During the initial session, Victor introduced us to the concept of Blender, its vibrant community, and the diverse range of applications it offers. When selecting a design tool, it is crucial to choose one that not only facilitates learning but also allows for versatile application. I knew that Blender serves as a powerful tool for animation, but I also discovered its other functions on CAD, rendering, and seamlessly connects with numerous devices and interfaces. While there are many tools that promise instant gratification by making things easier, we often tend to avoid investing time in learning such tools due to their lack of intuitiveness. However, this inclination towards simplicity primarily stems from a desire for quick solutions and personal validation. In the second session we started using Blender and learned basic functions in moving models in space and created an array. Victor showed us to use the coding interface of Blender to command the program rather than the basic interface tools. I guess this function is an advantage of Blender than the other CAD and rendering programs, Blender has a lot of ways to interact with it.

Unsurprisingly, I had a lot of problems with Arduino IDE and its libraries and could achieve to finalize the task that we wanted to achieve.

Briefly, our main goal is to support the makers and crafts, and encourage them to use digital fabrication tools. We agreed on using OPENCV shape detector. But, in order to use OPENCV we need PHYTON, ANACONDA and VISUAL STUDIO too. Firstly, we set the anaconda and PYTHON and OPENCV. Then we found a code for shape recognition-detection especially for \u201ccircle\u201d from an image. We tested that through the anaconda and of course code had some problems and we asked from CHATGPT to fix the code. More or less the code works through the image but we needed to calibrate the parameters in order to get more accurate results. During the second day we continued to work on shape detection code. After detecting the circles on the still images we tried to configure the code for squares, rectangle, triangle, semi/quarter circles. We used edge detection and tried to convert them to defined geometric shapes, but we had problems with some undefined ones as lemon shape or croissant shape. So, in order to solve this we worked on polygon contouring but it did not ended up with smooth curves. Then, Pietro joined to support us for using PYTHON libraries. After some discussions, we decided to use QR code detection in OPENCV libraries for assigned geometric shapes as we did with the fiducials on Grasshopper-firefly application model during the Challenge-No2 and we wanted to combine that with Three JS Interactive Voxel Painter project as a grid base. We spent some hours on this approach. Finally, we decided that would take months to finalize the work. We went back to the basic idea to detect the edges of the each geometric shapes on the grid that we designed and decided to eliminate the shades and work on lighting in order to get the best results with this basic and simple method which can be done on OPENCV and PYTHON. During the following two days, we mostly worked on building a new set of shape detecting and tile decorating kit in order to solve the problems of the previous one. Additionally, we built a frame out of hard wood in order to make a hydrolic tile. Hydrolic tile is an old method to decorate the tiles out of color pigments cement and dirt with the help of high pressure. By using our tile deco kit we captured a design and convert that into a STL file and we 3d printed the pattern that we want to paint the tile. We used the CNC machine to cut the frame out of wood. We used the laser cutter to make the tile deco kit out of plywood and acrylic. And we used 3d printer to print the inner frame to decorate the tile with color pigments. We are planing to test the kit next week and get ready for MDEF FEST. Personal note: During this challange we tried to use OpenCV and Python for the first time. Even if we couldn\u2019t get the results that we want it was a nice experience to try these digital tools. And, as I told to Santi and Victor this time we tried to work together rather than dividing the responsibilities and by this way it was more efficient for everyone to have the chance of trying digital tools.

To make our project as accessible as possible, we explored potential open-source interface and infrastructure programs. This aligns with the third challenge of the Prototyping for Design course, which we used to our advantage. Our intention was to address the issues with the grasshopper code for shape/fiducial detection and the interface of the grid. Although we experimented with other shape detection systems, we ultimately decided to continue with grasshopper, as it worked nearly perfectly. As a result, we merged our previous two projects and utilized fiducials to detect each geometric shape, facilitating the generation of designs on the grid-board. Once the design is captured by the camera, the grasshopper code can convert it into different formats, allowing us to export it for vinyl cutting or 3D printing. Consequently, we can create screen prints or hydraulic tiles with the same design. \u201cThe power of first person perspective; designing within the communities\u201d Collective Intervention no:6 As planned at the end of the second term, we proceeded with conducting interventions to test our gadget and design approach. As mentioned earlier, our primary focus is to support maker spaces and encourage makers/craftspeople to integrate digital tools and technologies into their work and workspaces. The gadget we developed during the second term serves as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Initially named Tile-Deco, we later upgraded it to Pixel Cubes, expanding its operating principles from 2D to 3D. In addition to this upgrade, we aimed to enrich the usage of our gadget and held a brainstorming session to explore alternative applications. Considering the importance of a first-person perspective approach in our interventions, practicability, applicability, and suitability for testing were our main considerations. We also took into account the applicability and testability during the brainstorming session, leading us to two ideas for testing our developed gadget. The first idea was to use it to generate designs for screen-printing, and the second idea was to explore the concept of hydraulic tiles. To start, we reached out to Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines to organize a screen-printing workshop. As a warm-up plan, we agreed to collaborate with a two-hour sewing workshop and share the space and participants. We made the necessary preparations and organization, but unfortunately, on the day of the workshop, the IAAC building experienced a flood, preventing us from bringing the vinyl cutter to Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines. Fortunately, we had already cut some stencils in advance. We briefly introduced ourselves and our gadget that is designed to generate unique designs for each participant. However, due to the last-minute issues, we had to explain that we would be using the pre-cut stencils. We then proceeded to explain the process of transferring the vinyl to the frame using transfer tape, providing a demonstration. Since it was not our workshop space, we needed tools such as tweezers, a cutter, scissors, and additional materials like tape. The space and participants were very enthusiastic about helping and supporting the workshop. Due to a heavy and unexpected rainstorm, there were only four participants in the workshop. Nevertheless, they brought their own fabric samples, shirts, and items. We aimed to avoid directing them too much, as we had learned from previous workshops at the same location. The primary ethos of Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines is generally to support makers and share experiences. After transferring the stencil onto the frame, participants selected their preferred colors, and we began the screen-printing process. Introduction of the gadget and explanation of the screen-printing process We demonstrated the process of screen-printing on white sheets that Amanda J. and Samantha Piercy provided from the old clothes and fabric recycling center. Initially, we showcased mono-color printing in our demonstrations, but our participants expressed their interest in mixing colors and creating patterns by applying the same design multiple times on their own. These attempts were highly motivating and encouraging for both us and the participants, confirming that we were in the right place and collaborating with the right community. A Demonstration of Screen-print (transfer of the vinyl, covering the frame, usage of color, application with spatula) During the first session, we applied screen-printing on various surfaces, textures, fabrics, and clothing items such as t-shirts, shirts, and pullovers. This allowed us to explore the versatility of the technique. Additionally, we received a request from the director and participants to repeat the workshop at the second anniversary party of CdFE. Their enthusiasm and creativity made us feel proud of our work. In conclusion, despite encountering some weather-related challenges, our first intervention was highly successful and provided valuable insights for testing our approach and the gadget we developed to support makers and encourage their integration of digital tools into their work. Colorful Results Collective Intervention No:7 As planned, we successfully organized the second screen printing workshop at the CdEF anniversary. This provided us with an opportunity to test the gadget we developed during the second and third terms, which I personally refer to as the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG). The workshop had a high level of participation, with over 30 makers from diverse backgrounds, including architects and finance professionals. Some of our MDEF colleagues also joined to support us. To begin, we provided a brief explanation of the workshop\u2019s main purpose and informed the participants about the equipment and the whole process. Ahmed Yakout took the lead in guiding them through the design generation process using the PTG, while Marc Pares and I carried out the vinyl cutting and stencil transfer for the screen printing process. Explaining the Grid-Board, Geometric Shapes, Vinyl Cutting, Screen-Printing During the design generation process, each participant provided us with different and valuable feedback. Since the grid and geometric shapes have magnets, participants were not entirely free to place items wherever they desired, which caused some initial confusion. However, we explained that the Grasshopper detects shapes with the reference of each square, which has a magnet at its center. This clarification led us to realize the need to redesign the grid interface to be more intuitive and avoid confusion. Surprisingly, some participants expressed a desire to design rectangle-shaped patterns instead of using the square-shaped grid, which challenged our initial assumption. The most significant and useful feedback from the workshop was the need to redesign the interface of the PTG to improve clarity. Participants experienced the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG) to generate their design Furthermore, the interactions we had during the vinyl cutting and stencil transfer process were highly valuable. After participants generated their designs on the PTG, Ahmed captured their patterns with the camera and used the Grasshopper to convert the files into .dxf format, which were then sent to us. We borrowed the vinyl cutter from IAAC and brought it to CdEF to cut the vinyl according to the participants\u2019 designs. We then transferred the stencils onto the frames using transfer tape. Throughout this process, we encouraged participants to assist us to maximize their hands-on experience. Many attendees found this process easier than anticipated and felt confident after gaining some support. Their newfound confidence was evident during the screen printing step, as they eagerly utilized the spatula to apply the ink throughout the frame to their fabric pieces. Screen-Printing Process Moreover, some participants expressed curiosity about the technology behind the PTG and sought to integrate it into their maker space. We provided a brief explanation, and one participant mentioned that their friend had designed the fiducial system we used in Grasshopper to detect shapes and reflect them on the computer screen through RhinoCeros. In conclusion, the second screen printing workshop was highly valuable in terms of interacting with a diverse group of people and receiving feedback to further develop our Phygital Therapy Grid. Personally, it provided me with valuable insights and boosted my confidence and enthusiasm for participatory design processes, which is a new experience for me after fifteen years of industrial design. Outcomes of the Workshop Alternative Explorations Besides the two screen-printing interventions we conducted, we also explored different ideas and applications to maximize the efficiency of the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG). During the interim period between the screen-printing workshops, we decided to collaborate with a ceramic artist named Evan, who works at \u201cStudio 137\u201d in Poblenou. We reached out to him, introduced ourselves, and presented our project, PTG. We visited his workshop at TMDC, and he showed interest in collaborating with us. After a quick brainstorming session, we decided to utilize our gadget to create a set of hydraulic tiles, an ancient tile production technique. During the third challenge of the Digital Prototyping class, we attempted to produce hydraulic tiles using the Phygital Therapy Grid. After capturing the design on the grid, we sent the file to Cura, the software for the 3D printer, and printed the design as a frame to define the tile pattern. We placed the 3D printed frame within the wooden frame we had constructed for hydraulic tile production. 3D-Printed Frame for Hydraulic Tile Decoration The next step involved preparing the color and cement mixtures for decorating the tiles. Normally, powdered color pigments are mixed with white cement, to which water is added. However, we used liquid color pigments typically used for fabric painting and mixed them with gray cement. To achieve the best result and avoid large particles, we sieved the gray cement. We then filled the 3D printed frame with the color pigments and cement mixtures according to the desired decoration. After removing the 3D printed frame, we added more cement by sieving it on top. In the first trial, we added a mixture of sand and cement on top and applied excessive pressure with the hydraulic press. The result was unsuccessful. For the second trial, we decided to add only cement on top, but it resulted in a dry and uneven finish. In the third and final trial, we applied thinner layers of cement, sprayed water on each layer, and applied 2 tons of pressure using the hydraulic press. The end result was quite satisfying. However, as we planned to organize a hydraulic tile workshop for MDEF-FEST, we decided to conduct further research to find the best recipe for hydraulic tiles before attempting another trial with Evan. First Trial Outcomes Once we agreed to organize the hydraulic tile making workshop for MDEF-FEST, we conducted a quick search for the tile mixture recipe. As it is an ancient craftsmanship process, finding a specific recipe proved challenging, and we even consulted Chat-GPT for assistance. Essentially, a single hydraulic tile consists of three layers: the top layer is made of marble powder, white cement, color pigments, and water; the middle layer consists of fine gray cement; and the bottom layer is a mixture of sand and cement. For the second trial, we obtained marble powder and white cement and made several attempts to achieve the best results. We experimented with different ratios for the top and bottom layers to optimize the production process. The main focus of the second trial was to improve the mold, as the imperfect edges of the tiles posed a challenge. Second Trial Outcomes Last Trial with the New Molds and Poster of the Workshop Ultimately, we realized that we are not professional tile makers but rather designers seeking to test the PTG for various applications. Despite not achieving perfect tiles, we decided to continue our journey and explore further possibilities.

Instead of adhering to the consumption culture\u2019s dictates on how to spend our money, I aim to inspire communities and individuals to be more productive and offer them support in various ways. Mariana Quintero coined the term \u201cParticipative Design Process\u201d to describe this approach, and as a designer, I aspire to work with and consult on these processes. One of my goals is to establish stronger connections between craftsmanship and new technologies to foster sustainable practices. Additionally, making new technologies accessible and understandable is another objective of these processes. The 5 W of Scaling and Continuity Why? To form a community, make technology accessible for everyone, encourage people-makers to participate into design processes and digital fabrication tools. Built an alternative way for design and production processes in the age of post industrial revolution era. What? Simplify and integrate digital fabrication tools to participative design processes. Who? Makers and DIY enthusiasts Where? Around maker spaces and product libraries When? From now on\u2026 How? Which structures can be used? Job/Freelance Business/Startup Non-profit/Cooperations Collective/Network Event/Physical space Academic Research Documentation/Guide Personally, I am keen on further developing Participative Design Processes by organizing more events, collaborating with different maker spaces, and engaging with other networks. Consulting on participative design processes will lead me down different paths and enable me to gain deeper insights into the design and production processes. Furthermore, documenting and publishing these processes can create more opportunities to establish new connections and networks. In summary, harnessing the potential of collective making, thinking, and designing is crucial in promoting participative design processes. Chapter 11: Final Reflection As an industrial designer, I have had the opportunity to work on project briefs that range from strict to flexible over the course of fifteen years in various design fields. Seeking to explore a different design methodology, I enrolled in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF) program. My previous design experiences involved predominantly working alone or in collaboration with other professionals, primarily utilizing computer-based design tools. In some cases, I had the luxury of conducting observations to inform design decisions, but I was often the sole individual responsible for considering the entire usage scenario of a product, system, or service. Understanding and internalizing the core concepts of the MDEF program, such as \u201cDesign Intervention,\u201d \u201cFirst Person Perspective,\u201d \u201cDesigning within the Communities,\u201d and \u201cInterconnectivity,\u201d proved to be a gradual process. It took time to fully grasp the significance and value of these terms. However, by the middle of the second term, I began to appreciate their meaning as I gained more experience interacting with communities. Concepts like \u201cdesign intervention\u201d and \u201cfirst person perspective\u201d started to resonate with me, fostering a growing sense of confidence. With the assistance of the MDEF program\u2019s content, I was able to explore a range of topics and acquire the necessary skills to pursue the path I desired. The combination of lectures and hands-on learning provided a comfortable environment that encouraged exploration. Despite occasional frustrations with the workload, I considered myself fortunate to have the opportunity to discover numerous new technologies, software tools, and production methods. I have previously expressed my thoughts on the MDEF program\u2019s content and the importance of elective courses, particularly given the diverse backgrounds and bachelor degrees of the students in the program. I strongly believe that the inclusion of elective classes would enhance the efficiency of the master\u2019s program for its participants. I would also like to reiterate the significance of \u201cemergent futures\u201d and \u201calternative presents\u201d as key concepts within this master\u2019s program. Rather than focusing solely on speculative future scenarios, I learned to generate alternative present approaches by combining today\u2019s tools with emergent technologies. This perspective became increasingly evident to me throughout the trimester, as I followed the steps, concepts, and ideas in my design journey. Moreover, both individually and collectively, I delved into various topics and engaged with different communities, allowing me to develop a new design perspective. My MDEF journey began with a personal interest in \u201curban productivity practices,\u201d followed by collaborative work on \u201cplayfully production practices\u201d with colleagues, emphasizing low-tech approaches. Subsequently, I had the opportunity to conduct research and implement gray-water collection, filtration, and recycling systems alongside other colleagues. Ultimately, I culminated my journey with a project that integrated digital fabrication tools into craftsmen\u2019s workspaces, empowering maker communities to make efficient use of technology. Along the way, I interacted with community gardens, attended numerous workshops, visited craftsmen\u2019s workshops, made observations in supportive maker spaces and product libraries, organized workshops, and shared my knowledge and experiences with participants. I embraced the role of a designer as a mediator rather than the sole decision-maker, and this shift in attitude brought me greater comfort. In conclusion, my journey in the Master of Design for the Emergent Futures program introduced me to a new design approach. Emphasizing the first-person perspective, designing within communities, and hands-on learning were the key takeaways from this trimester. I have significantly developed my vision and eagerly anticipate applying my newfound skills in various fields, ranging from urban productivity practices to participatory design practices. I firmly believe that I will increasingly contribute to and consult on participatory design practices in the near future.","title":"Design Studio III"},{"location":"term3/07-Design%20Studio%20III/#design-studio-iii","text":"Design Studio III Chapter 8: Final Interventions We began the third term with the aim of further developing the gadget that we had been working on, which combines the physical and digital worlds to support the integration of digital fabrication tools in maker spaces. To make our project as accessible as possible, we explored potential open-source interface and infrastructure programs. This aligns with the third challenge of the Prototyping for Design course, which we used to our advantage. Our intention was to address the issues with the grasshopper code for shape/fiducial detection and the interface of the grid. Although we experimented with other shape detection systems, we ultimately decided to continue with grasshopper, as it worked nearly perfectly. As a result, we merged our previous two projects and utilized fiducials to detect each geometric shape, facilitating the generation of designs on the grid-board. Once the design is captured by the camera, the grasshopper code can convert it into different formats, allowing us to export it for vinyl cutting or 3D printing. Consequently, we can create screen prints or hydraulic tiles with the same design. \u201cThe power of first person perspective; designing within the communities\u201d Collective Intervention no:6 As planned at the end of the second term, we proceeded with conducting interventions to test our gadget and design approach. As mentioned earlier, our primary focus is to support maker spaces and encourage makers/craftspeople to integrate digital tools and technologies into their work and workspaces. The gadget we developed during the second term serves as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Initially named Tile-Deco, we later upgraded it to Pixel Cubes, expanding its operating principles from 2D to 3D. In addition to this upgrade, we aimed to enrich the usage of our gadget and held a brainstorming session to explore alternative applications. Considering the importance of a first-person perspective approach in our interventions, practicability, applicability, and suitability for testing were our main considerations. We also took into account the applicability and testability during the brainstorming session, leading us to two ideas for testing our developed gadget. The first idea was to use it to generate designs for screen-printing, and the second idea was to explore the concept of hydraulic tiles. To start, we reached out to Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines to organize a screen-printing workshop. As a warm-up plan, we agreed to collaborate with a two-hour sewing workshop and share the space and participants. We made the necessary preparations and organization, but unfortunately, on the day of the workshop, the IAAC building experienced a flood, preventing us from bringing the vinyl cutter to Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines. Fortunately, we had already cut some stencils in advance. We briefly introduced ourselves and our gadget that is designed to generate unique designs for each participant. However, due to the last-minute issues, we had to explain that we would be using the pre-cut stencils. We then proceeded to explain the process of transferring the vinyl to the frame using transfer tape, providing a demonstration. Since it was not our workshop space, we needed tools such as tweezers, a cutter, scissors, and additional materials like tape. The space and participants were very enthusiastic about helping and supporting the workshop. Due to a heavy and unexpected rainstorm, there were only four participants in the workshop. Nevertheless, they brought their own fabric samples, shirts, and items. We aimed to avoid directing them too much, as we had learned from previous workshops at the same location. The primary ethos of Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines is generally to support makers and share experiences. After transferring the stencil onto the frame, participants selected their preferred colors, and we began the screen-printing process. Introduction of the gadget and explanation of the screen-printing process We demonstrated the process of screen-printing on white sheets that Amanda J. and Samantha Piercy provided from the old clothes and fabric recycling center. Initially, we showcased mono-color printing in our demonstrations, but our participants expressed their interest in mixing colors and creating patterns by applying the same design multiple times on their own. These attempts were highly motivating and encouraging for both us and the participants, confirming that we were in the right place and collaborating with the right community. A Demonstration of Screen-print (transfer of the vinyl, covering the frame, usage of color, application with spatula) During the first session, we applied screen-printing on various surfaces, textures, fabrics, and clothing items such as t-shirts, shirts, and pullovers. This allowed us to explore the versatility of the technique. Additionally, we received a request from the director and participants to repeat the workshop at the second anniversary party of CdFE. Their enthusiasm and creativity made us feel proud of our work. In conclusion, despite encountering some weather-related challenges, our first intervention was highly successful and provided valuable insights for testing our approach and the gadget we developed to support makers and encourage their integration of digital tools into their work. Colorful Results Collective Intervention No:7 As planned, we successfully organized the second screen printing workshop at the CdEF anniversary. This provided us with an opportunity to test the gadget we developed during the second and third terms, which I personally refer to as the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG). The workshop had a high level of participation, with over 30 makers from diverse backgrounds, including architects and finance professionals. Some of our MDEF colleagues also joined to support us. To begin, we provided a brief explanation of the workshop\u2019s main purpose and informed the participants about the equipment and the whole process. Ahmed Yakout took the lead in guiding them through the design generation process using the PTG, while Marc Pares and I carried out the vinyl cutting and stencil transfer for the screen printing process. Explaining the Grid-Board, Geometric Shapes, Vinyl Cutting, Screen-Printing During the design generation process, each participant provided us with different and valuable feedback. Since the grid and geometric shapes have magnets, participants were not entirely free to place items wherever they desired, which caused some initial confusion. However, we explained that the Grasshopper detects shapes with the reference of each square, which has a magnet at its center. This clarification led us to realize the need to redesign the grid interface to be more intuitive and avoid confusion. Surprisingly, some participants expressed a desire to design rectangle-shaped patterns instead of using the square-shaped grid, which challenged our initial assumption. The most significant and useful feedback from the workshop was the need to redesign the interface of the PTG to improve clarity. Participants experienced the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG) to generate their design Furthermore, the interactions we had during the vinyl cutting and stencil transfer process were highly valuable. After participants generated their designs on the PTG, Ahmed captured their patterns with the camera and used the Grasshopper to convert the files into .dxf format, which were then sent to us. We borrowed the vinyl cutter from IAAC and brought it to CdEF to cut the vinyl according to the participants\u2019 designs. We then transferred the stencils onto the frames using transfer tape. Throughout this process, we encouraged participants to assist us to maximize their hands-on experience. Many attendees found this process easier than anticipated and felt confident after gaining some support. Their newfound confidence was evident during the screen printing step, as they eagerly utilized the spatula to apply the ink throughout the frame to their fabric pieces. Screen-Printing Process Moreover, some participants expressed curiosity about the technology behind the PTG and sought to integrate it into their maker space. We provided a brief explanation, and one participant mentioned that their friend had designed the fiducial system we used in Grasshopper to detect shapes and reflect them on the computer screen through RhinoCeros. In conclusion, the second screen printing workshop was highly valuable in terms of interacting with a diverse group of people and receiving feedback to further develop our Phygital Therapy Grid. Personally, it provided me with valuable insights and boosted my confidence and enthusiasm for participatory design processes, which is a new experience for me after fifteen years of industrial design. Outcomes of the Workshop Alternative Explorations Besides the two screen-printing interventions we conducted, we also explored different ideas and applications to maximize the efficiency of the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG). During the interim period between the screen-printing workshops, we decided to collaborate with a ceramic artist named Evan, who works at \u201cStudio 137\u201d in Poblenou. We reached out to him, introduced ourselves, and presented our project, PTG. We visited his workshop at TMDC, and he showed interest in collaborating with us. After a quick brainstorming session, we decided to utilize our gadget to create a set of hydraulic tiles, an ancient tile production technique. During the third challenge of the Digital Prototyping class, we attempted to produce hydraulic tiles using the Phygital Therapy Grid. After capturing the design on the grid, we sent the file to Cura, the software for the 3D printer, and printed the design as a frame to define the tile pattern. We placed the 3D printed frame within the wooden frame we had constructed for hydraulic tile production. 3D-Printed Frame for Hydraulic Tile Decoration The next step involved preparing the color and cement mixtures for decorating the tiles. Normally, powdered color pigments are mixed with white cement, to which water is added. However, we used liquid color pigments typically used for fabric painting and mixed them with gray cement. To achieve the best result and avoid large particles, we sieved the gray cement. We then filled the 3D printed frame with the color pigments and cement mixtures according to the desired decoration. After removing the 3D printed frame, we added more cement by sieving it on top. In the first trial, we added a mixture of sand and cement on top and applied excessive pressure with the hydraulic press. The result was unsuccessful. For the second trial, we decided to add only cement on top, but it resulted in a dry and uneven finish. In the third and final trial, we applied thinner layers of cement, sprayed water on each layer, and applied 2 tons of pressure using the hydraulic press. The end result was quite satisfying. However, as we planned to organize a hydraulic tile workshop for MDEF-FEST, we decided to conduct further research to find the best recipe for hydraulic tiles before attempting another trial with Evan. First Trial Outcomes Once we agreed to organize the hydraulic tile making workshop for MDEF-FEST, we conducted a quick search for the tile mixture recipe. As it is an ancient craftsmanship process, finding a specific recipe proved challenging, and we even consulted Chat-GPT for assistance. Essentially, a single hydraulic tile consists of three layers: the top layer is made of marble powder, white cement, color pigments, and water; the middle layer consists of fine gray cement; and the bottom layer is a mixture of sand and cement. For the second trial, we obtained marble powder and white cement and made several attempts to achieve the best results. We experimented with different ratios for the top and bottom layers to optimize the production process. The main focus of the second trial was to improve the mold, as the imperfect edges of the tiles posed a challenge. Second Trial Outcomes Last Trial with the New Molds and Poster of the Workshop Ultimately, we realized that we are not professional tile makers but rather designers seeking to test the PTG for various applications. Despite not achieving perfect tiles, we decided to continue our journey and explore further possibilities. My Personal Design Space (Term 3) My Personal Design Space (overall) Chapter 9: Final Alternative Present \u201cParticipative Design Processes\u201d that include digital fabrication tools and combine them with traditional production techniques encourage makers to be more productive in urban spaces and support them in integrating technology into their workspaces in the age of the post-industrial revolution. In other words, makers gain confidence in using new technologies in their work and seamlessly blend traditional techniques with digital fabrication tools to enhance productivity both individually and within their communities, with the aid of \u201cParticipative Design Processes\u201d. Chapter 10: Designing yourself out: Strategies for Continuity and Scalability Creativity in personal and collective spaces, support for maker movements, supply chain hacking, democratizing production, and providing alternatives for the post-industrial revolution era regardless of the terminology used, my primary objective is to explore alternative approaches that enhance productivity in urban spaces. Instead of adhering to the consumption culture\u2019s dictates on how to spend our money, I aim to inspire communities and individuals to be more productive and offer them support in various ways. Mariana Quintero coined the term \u201cParticipative Design Process\u201d to describe this approach, and as a designer, I aspire to work with and consult on these processes. One of my goals is to establish stronger connections between craftsmanship and new technologies to foster sustainable practices. Additionally, making new technologies accessible and understandable is another objective of these processes. The 5 W of Scaling and Continuity Why? To form a community, make technology accessible for everyone, encourage people-makers to participate into design processes and digital fabrication tools.

Moving from scale of individual to building, neighborhoods and cities in order to maintain the sustainability. How to map a system? Task 1: As the first assignment we worked on a system mapping for \u201cThe driver for new demolition and new construction activity in Barcelona\u201d. System mapping based on \u201cNodes\u201d and \u201cLoops\u201d. \u201cNodes\u201d can be representatives of the factors, causes, results, problems, solutions. So, we can create \u201cLoops\u201d which as the symbols of systems. That\u2019s why we are calling it System Mapping\u201d I worked within the group of 5 to make a system mapping for the first assignment. We discussed and defined the \u201cMaterial Demand\u201d as the main node which is the result of demolition and construction activity in Barcelona that led by the \u201cHousing Demand\u201d which is another node. Housing demand is effected by population growth and tourism. We also agreed on the immigration (especially digital nomads) and refugee crisis (because of war and climate change) factors that effect the population growth. As material demand increases material transportation also increase and both result with a negative effect on the environmental sustainability. And, less sustainable environment will cause more refugees of climate change. On the other hand, housing demolition and construction as a result of the governmental policy ends up with the gentrification which causes increase in the cost of living which means more housing demand for the low income population. During the review we got feedback especially for the governmental policy and sustainable materials. As we are spending so much time at IAAC we idealize the sustainable material idea so a lot and at the end we decided to add a node of \u201cNGOs and Academy Projects\u201d as the environmental impact getting into consideration. This node let us to draw a loop for sustainable materials which have less impact on the environment. Also, governmental policy has an indirect effect on sustainable material node. Material Story Task 2: Presentation / Diagram for a certain material(BRICK) in the Atelier building and search through EPD(ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION) in order to calculate its CO2 release and effect on the GWP(Global Warming Potential). First of all we visited the building and defined the brick. Mainly two types of bricks were used to construct the building; Mostly red bricks (columns, back walls and right side wall) and additionally, clay hollow bricks used on the left side wall and painted. So, we made a research on ibu-epd.com to see the EPD and find out the GWP of the two types of bricks. We also considered the GWP of the paint. Then, we use the 3d model of the building two present the brick walls and columns. We located the 3d model and added our photos that we took. We also remarked that some openings on the back wall were filled up with new (shaped egdes) red bricks. It was obvious that that addings did not applied by a qualified labor as the surface finishes and structure of the added wall. Also, we saw some other fill-ups the holes for old timber beams. TOTAL GWP FOR BUILDING: COLUMNS: 1.21 E +04/ LEFT INTERIOR WALL: 4.39 E+03/ PAINT ON LEFT INTERIOR WALL: 5.7 E+01/ INTERIOR BACK WALLS & RIGHT WALL: 1.70 E+04 TOTAL: 3.36 E+04 As a final visualization of the GWP of the Atelier Building we made the visualizations of the raw material extraction/sieving, transport of the raw material to manufacturing site, manufacturing process, transport of the bricks to construction site and construction-installation process. We also defined the GWP numbers accordingly and also in total. **Raw Material Supply:**12216E/ **Transport to Pro-Site:**571E/ **Manufacturing Process:**17182E/ **Transport to Const-Site:**1253E/ **Construction-Insta Pro:**2325E TOTAL GWP: 33347E Task 3: Deconstruction and reuse scenarios(proposals) of the brick walls and columns of the Atelier building. Basically, the main idea of the 3 rd part of the lecture and task is to create an alternative project to use the bricks instead of demolish the whole structure and use to landfilling. By this method, we will be able to have less environmental impact by reducing the GWP. In order to so, we made a small research on the state of art projects and we found some creative and effective usage of brick blocks. As the brick walls need a lot of qualified labor both to build and deconstruct, it is hard to store the bricks separately from the mortar after being demolished. We proposed cutting blocks from the walls and columns and rebuild/reattach them on panels which would be used as collage brick facades. At first we define the conditions of the bricks and visualized that with color coding. We use bricks in good, bad and new conditions. Secondly, we went through the axonometric view of the walls and columns that we proposed to cut into blocks to rebuild collage brick panels. After that stage we tried to cut the walls into with the dimensions 1meterX1meter and 0,5meterX1meter and columns into blocks with the dimensions 0,6meterX1,2meter. As a visualized material story of the bricks after deconstruction process that being cut into blocks and rebuilt into collage brick panel walls, we used the 4 main stages; Deconstruction, Transportation, Storage and Reuse. Presentation Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wZoNghK-11OKKKtnszYIYMjdOUALgpphS6gEYqnC8bM/edit?usp=sharing Design by caglaralkan To sum up, during the lecture we went through the system mapping, material story of a construction and its GWP and deconstruction proposals of a certain material. The second part of the tasks were really inspiring for searching alternatives for bricks rather than demolishing a building and use the ruins in landfilling. I discovered about the GWP and how to make calculation in the building scale.

Task 1: As the first assignment we worked on a system mapping for \u201cThe driver for new demolition and new construction activity in Barcelona\u201d. System mapping based on \u201cNodes\u201d and \u201cLoops\u201d. \u201cNodes\u201d can be representatives of the factors, causes, results, problems, solutions. So, we can create \u201cLoops\u201d which as the symbols of systems. That\u2019s why we are calling it System Mapping\u201d I worked within the group of 5 to make a system mapping for the first assignment. We discussed and defined the \u201cMaterial Demand\u201d as the main node which is the result of demolition and construction activity in Barcelona that led by the \u201cHousing Demand\u201d which is another node. Housing demand is effected by population growth and tourism. We also agreed on the immigration (especially digital nomads) and refugee crisis (because of war and climate change) factors that effect the population growth. As material demand increases material transportation also increase and both result with a negative effect on the environmental sustainability. And, less sustainable environment will cause more refugees of climate change. On the other hand, housing demolition and construction as a result of the governmental policy ends up with the gentrification which causes increase in the cost of living which means more housing demand for the low income population. During the review we got feedback especially for the governmental policy and sustainable materials. As we are spending so much time at IAAC we idealize the sustainable material idea so a lot and at the end we decided to add a node of \u201cNGOs and Academy Projects\u201d as the environmental impact getting into consideration. This node let us to draw a loop for sustainable materials which have less impact on the environment. Also, governmental policy has an indirect effect on sustainable material node. Material Story Task 2: Presentation / Diagram for a certain material(BRICK) in the Atelier building and search through EPD(ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION) in order to calculate its CO2 release and effect on the GWP(Global Warming Potential). First of all we visited the building and defined the brick. Mainly two types of bricks were used to construct the building; Mostly red bricks (columns, back walls and right side wall) and additionally, clay hollow bricks used on the left side wall and painted. So, we made a research on ibu-epd.com to see the EPD and find out the GWP of the two types of bricks. We also considered the GWP of the paint. Then, we use the 3d model of the building two present the brick walls and columns. We located the 3d model and added our photos that we took. We also remarked that some openings on the back wall were filled up with new (shaped egdes) red bricks. It was obvious that that addings did not applied by a qualified labor as the surface finishes and structure of the added wall. Also, we saw some other fill-ups the holes for old timber beams. TOTAL GWP FOR BUILDING: COLUMNS: 1.21 E +04/ LEFT INTERIOR WALL: 4.39 E+03/ PAINT ON LEFT INTERIOR WALL: 5.7 E+01/ INTERIOR BACK WALLS & RIGHT WALL: 1.70 E+04 TOTAL: 3.36 E+04 As a final visualization of the GWP of the Atelier Building we made the visualizations of the raw material extraction/sieving, transport of the raw material to manufacturing site, manufacturing process, transport of the bricks to construction site and construction-installation process. We also defined the GWP numbers accordingly and also in total. **Raw Material Supply:**12216E/ **Transport to Pro-Site:**571E/ **Manufacturing Process:**17182E/ **Transport to Const-Site:**1253E/ **Construction-Insta Pro:**2325E TOTAL GWP: 33347E Task 3: Deconstruction and reuse scenarios(proposals) of the brick walls and columns of the Atelier building. Basically, the main idea of the 3 rd part of the lecture and task is to create an alternative project to use the bricks instead of demolish the whole structure and use to landfilling. By this method, we will be able to have less environmental impact by reducing the GWP. In order to so, we made a small research on the state of art projects and we found some creative and effective usage of brick blocks. As the brick walls need a lot of qualified labor both to build and deconstruct, it is hard to store the bricks separately from the mortar after being demolished. We proposed cutting blocks from the walls and columns and rebuild/reattach them on panels which would be used as collage brick facades. At first we define the conditions of the bricks and visualized that with color coding. We use bricks in good, bad and new conditions. Secondly, we went through the axonometric view of the walls and columns that we proposed to cut into blocks to rebuild collage brick panels. After that stage we tried to cut the walls into with the dimensions 1meterX1meter and 0,5meterX1meter and columns into blocks with the dimensions 0,6meterX1,2meter. As a visualized material story of the bricks after deconstruction process that being cut into blocks and rebuilt into collage brick panel walls, we used the 4 main stages; Deconstruction, Transportation, Storage and Reuse. Presentation Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wZoNghK-11OKKKtnszYIYMjdOUALgpphS6gEYqnC8bM/edit?usp=sharing Design by caglaralkan To sum up, during the lecture we went through the system mapping, material story of a construction and its GWP and deconstruction proposals of a certain material. The second part of the tasks were really inspiring for searching alternatives for bricks rather than demolishing a building and use the ruins in landfilling. I discovered about the GWP and how to make calculation in the building scale. Additionally, proposing alternative projects to reusing the brick walls and columnist order to have less environmental impact with construction and demolishment activities were really inspiring.","title":"Circular Matter"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/","text":"Master Project \u00b6 HANDBOOK FOR MAKERSPACES Introduction \u00b6 After spending a year in the MDEF01, delving into the community-based design approach and proposing alternative futures with the support of existing and future technologies, I have decided to continue my journey through MDEF02, focusing on maker movements. My aim is to explore new ways and methods to support creative personal spaces and community-based participative design processes by developing projects that combines digital fabrication tools and traditional craftsman techniques and projects in the makerspaces. This journey is also a guiding force for realizing my dream of establishing my own maker space, a dream I\u2019ve nurtured for 15 years. In a conversation with Tom\u00e1s D\u00edez-Master in Design for Emergent Futures(MDEF) program director-, he recommended careful consideration of various aspects, including location, an atlas of weak signals for those locations, available resources (people, space, stakeholders, financial support, potential collaborators, business model), and more. To initiate this endeavor, several fundamental steps must be defined to structure the idea of building and developing a maker space. These include questions such as: How to build a maker space? How to integrate digital fabrication tools into maker spaces? What projects can be developed to support makers/crafts, enhancing the idea of makerspaces and gaining recognition? How to combine a startup model with the idea of a maker space? Throughout this process, I plan to visit and participate in workshops on various topics in different makerspaces, and collaborate with makers from diverse backgrounds to understand multiple perspectives and needs of makers, participants, visitors, and staff. Through these interactions and collaborations, I aim to gain more experience and knowledge on the subject. By sharing our knowledge, we can create more opportunities for integrating digital fabrication tools into maker spaces and reinvigorating craftsmanship methods with the help of new technologies. In the era post-industrial revolution, the monopoly of manufacturers, restrictions in supply chains, and susceptibility to digital marketing attacks have dampened the productive and creative capacity of human beings. Fortunately, there is still a chance to hack the system and rediscover our abilities to produce, make, and grow our own goods locally, leveraging traditional knowledge and today\u2019s tools. Makerspaces serve as strong indicators, pioneers, and supporters of this movement. This research aims to provide guidance for individuals or groups interested in building their own or collective makerspaces. The primary focus of this research will be on urban productivity practices. In the realm of productivity and creativity, not only making but also growing represents a way to develop and rediscover our ability to add and create value in our environment. Therefore, urban farming will also be included in urban productivity practices during this research. Beyond the outcomes, making and growing involve multiple layers that guide makers toward their results. Throughout this research, I will attempt to define most of these steps, providing an alternative way of urban living in the era of post-industrial revolution, technology, and digitalization. First and foremost, this research will analyze the general structure of makerspaces, the ideology behind them, their management systems, and their marketing and development plans. Additionally, the research will explore and classify the makerspace movement according to industrially integrated, technologically integrated, and low-tech/craftsmanship models. Furthermore, I will draw on references such as thesis projects, books, articles, TEDx talks, and websites. Beyond those, I will also organize meetings, interviews, workshops, surveys with both maker space owners and participants that contribute those spaces. In line with the hands-on learning principles of MDEF program, this research will be an outcome of both theoretical information and creative hands-on practices. Throughout the literature review I will mention some names, books, websites and articles; \u201cNeil Gershenfeld\u201d- computer scientist and physicist, director of MIT\u2019s Center for Bits and Atoms,- and his book \u201cFab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop\u2014from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication\u201d. Neil Gershenfeld is widely recognized as the originator of Fab Labs(Fabrication Laboratories- tech base makerspaces). He introduced the idea of Fab Labs in the early 2000s as a way to provide communities with access to digital fabrication tools and technologies, enabling them to create and innovate at the local level. \u201cChris Anderson\u201d -an entrepreneur- and his book \u201cMakers: The New Industrial Revolution\u201d. Chris Anderson, a prominent figure in the maker movement, has significantly contributed to its popularization through his writings and activities. The book explores the impact of modern manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing and open-source hardware, on the economy and society. \u201cTom\u00e1s D\u00edez\u201d -an advocate of tech literacy at the grassroots level and co-founder of Fab Lab BCN- and his article \u201cPersonal Fabrication: Fab Labs as Platforms for Citizen-Based Innovation, from Microcontrollers to Cities\u201d. As an advocate of tech literacy and co-founder of Fab Lab BCN, Tom\u00e1s D\u00edez explores how digital fabrication tools empower communities, promote sustainable practices, and enable individuals to turn their ideas into tangible products. \u201cNurg\u00fcl Meri\u00e7liler\u201d -an architect and maker- and her thesis \u201cAn Interdisciplinary Perspective Towards MakerSpaces: 5 Cases from London\u201d.

Personal, distributed, open fabrication\u201d by Tom\u00e1s D\u00edez In the first chapter, I will conduct a literature review to elucidate concepts such as \u2018What is making?,\u2019 \u2018Who is a maker?,\u2019 \u2018What is a makerspace?,\u2019 \u2018Types of Makerspaces,\u2019 \u2018Maker Movement,\u2019 and \u2018The history and other processes that support the maker movement.\u2019 Subsequently, as a case study, I will analyze five makerspaces in Barcelona city, varying in scale and content, to illustrate the main structure of a makerspace and its impacts on society. This analysis will encompass different management approaches and community engagement plans. Finally, I will conclude the chapter by summarizing the outcomes of this case study and segue into the next chapter of the project. During the first chapter of this framework, my focus will be on the makerspaces in Barcelona. Currently residing in Barcelona, I find it advantageous to engage with them physically. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to attend events and workshops hosted by these makerspaces in their physical spaces. This first-hand experience has allowed me to observe their interactions with the community, understand their production processes, and witness their organizational methods. Barcelona stands out from other European cities as an ideal location for investigating makerspaces due to the widespread use of community-based networks, projects, and digital fabrication techniques. The city, being a center and model of urbanization in Europe, offers a unique cultural perspective. The second chapter will predominantly cover topics such as \u2018Working on the Context of a Makerspace,\u2019 \u2018Sustainability Plan,\u2019 \u2018Planning the Physical Space,\u2019 and \u2018Community Engagement Plan.\u2019 I will initiate contact with potential collaborators and stakeholders in the initial stages. Finally, for the last chapter, I will make search for European Funds, local funds, develop a business plan, and work on establishment strategies. To sum up, in the era of post industrial revolution, maker movements become more visible since 10-15 years. Open source concepts, digital fabrication tools, and participative design processes supports the makers in the urban spaces. Through this research I will examine the structures, management methods, community engagement plans, business models and establishment processes of several makerspaces. Consequently, there will be a handbook that would be used as a guidance for makers who would like to build their own makerspaces. Chapter 1: Literature Review and Case Study \u00b6 1.1. What is Making? \u00b6 We are in an era where every gadget, especially electronics, often leads us to live more individualistically with the support of digital tools. This is why the phrase \u201cFood is the new internet\u201d has become popular in some circles, emphasizing the idea that activities like sharing food bring people together in physical spaces. In a similar vein, we could propose a new motto: \u201cMaking is the new clubbing.\u201d Making not only fosters creativity, productivity, and cooperation but also enhances social connections and a sense of community, reinforcing our ties to the neighborhood and cultivating a stronger sense of citizenship. Making is a multifaceted endeavor that goes beyond the mere act of creation. \u201cMaking is an activity that encourages people to use their minds more holistically for creating, using, and sharing\u201d (Canino-Fluit, 2014), on her article Canino suggests that making involves a comprehensive engagement of the mind, encompassing the creative process, utilization of created objects, and sharing of knowledge or creations with others. Canino emphasizes the holistic nature of the mental activities involved in the act of making. In line with Caninos approach, \u201cMaking is a process and a practice, not just an outcome.\u201d (Loes Bogers & Letizia Chiappini, 2019, p.9), according to Bogers and Chiappini making is presented as an ongoing process and a continuous practice, highlighting that the value of making extends beyond the final product. The emphasis is on the journey, learning, and skills development that occur during the making process. As a blend of these two, David Gauntlett \u201cMaking is connecting\u201d (2011) approaches to making as a form of connection, not just between physical materials but also between people. The act of making can bring individuals together, fostering connections and collaboration. It underscores the social aspect of making and its potential to build relationships. Making is a broad term that is used to refer the action of creating, producing, manufacturing an object, but mostly adding a value and meaning on an artefact. In his book \u201cMakers: The New Industrial Revolution,\u201d (2012) Anderson refers making as an act of creating physical objects using various tools, equipments, and manufacturing techniques. Making, in this way, goes beyond traditional craftsmanship with the support of modern technologies such as 3D printing, CNC machining, and other digital fabrication methods. Anderson describes making as a democratizing force that empowers individuals and communities to become and innovators, creators and entrepreneurs. Anderson describes making as a fundamental shift from traditional mass production to personalized, small-scale manufacturing. Additionally, Neil Gershenfeld, in his book \u201cFab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop-from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication,\u201d (2005) approaches to making as a fundamental human capability,and sees making as a transformative process that allows individuals to move beyond just being consumers of products to becoming participative producers. Gershenfeld believes that digital fabrication tools, such as 3D printers and laser cutters, can empower communities by providing access to technology and enabling individuals to turn their ideas into reality. On the other hand, it is essential to take a look on the definition of hacking when the subject is making. Hacking is has been used since 1960s. Whereas hacking involves the modification or repurposing of existing technology, making more centers around the creation of new artifacts from scratch. Both hacking and making promote open-source principles, encouraging collaboration and the sharing of ideas within a community of like-minded enthusiasts and contribute to the democratization of technology by breaking down traditional barriers and fostering a culture of innovation and resourcefulness. Even both activities need creativity, the slang term hacking used to sound a bit negative while making have more positive sense, making can be seen as a kind of hacking the system, industry, marketing, supply chain, monopoly in order to create alternative ways of living, producing, consuming, sharing. As Nurg\u00fcl Meri\u00e7liler summarizes that \u201cThe meanings of making and identifying as a maker are subjects of ongoing discussion, similar to the term hacking. While making is often linked to the utilization of digital tools, it also encompasses traditional creative practices like knitting, sewing, woodworking, and metalworking.\u201d (Meri\u00e7liler, 2023, p.29) To sum up, this framework approaches making as a process of producing knowledge than focusing on an artefact. Making encompasses a wide range of activities, including creating, producing, crafting, tinkering, building, and growing. It represents an intersection of art/craft and science, incorporating traditional techniques, technology, and design. It is a comprehensive term referring to the action of creating, producing, and manufacturing objects, with a primary focus on adding value and meaning to artifacts. 1.2. Who is a Maker? \u00b6 \u201cWe are born Makers\u201d Chris Anderson \u201cWe are all Makers\u201d Dale Dougherty I certainly believe that we, as humans, possess amazing skills, particularly in survival, with instinctive abilities and an innate capacity to learn, discover, and improve. We have been transforming the world since the day we started crafting tools from stones and wood. However, personally, I disagree with the notion that we are all born makers. The influences of capitalism, industry, and marketing gurus have caused many individuals to overlook their creative potential. Numerous people are ensnared by ready-made meals provided by supermarket chains, and many struggle to prepare a simple dish to feed themselves. In his book \u201cMakers: The New Industrial Revolution,\u201d Chris Anderson describes makers as individuals who leverage modern manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing and open-source hardware, to innovate and create. In addition to tech-knowledge, entrepreneurship, and creativity are the other two essentials of Anderson\u2019s vision and definition of being a maker. Even though the cool term \u2018maker\u2019 commonly refers to a person with knowledge and skills in using digital tools like 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC machine cutting, and a 6-axis robot arm, this framework aims to define a maker from a broader perspective. In behalf of this exploration of the maker definition we have to analyze some more related terms as \u2018craft\u2019, \u2018hobbyist\u2019, \u2018do-it-yourselfer\u2019. Firstly, craft refers to the skilled practice of making things by hand. It often involves traditional techniques and artistic qualities and usually craft is a person who is an expert on a specific occupation with perfect skills in order to fulfill the tasks that necessary for the production processes. Secondly, a hobbyist is someone who engages in a particular hobby, which is a regular activity done for enjoyment during one\u2019s leisure time without financial gain focus. Thirdly, a DIYer is an individual who engages in the practice of doing tasks or creating things on their own, typically without professional assistance. DIYers mostly focus on home improvement projects, repairments, or creative endeavors. Self-sufficiency and personal accomplishment are the main take ons. Finally, a maker is someone who creates or constructs things, often using a combination of traditional and modern tools and technologies. The maker has a broader and more contemporary scope, incorporating a diverse range of skills and technologies, often with an emphasis on collaboration and sharing. Certainly, these terms\u2014hobbyist, craft, DIYer, and maker\u2014encompass a spectrum of creative pursuits, productivity and time commitment. A hobbyist engages in activities for personal pleasure during leisure, which may include crafts or DIY projects. Additionally, hobby is an activity that someone reproduce, copy, and repeat, while making is a way of being productive with more discipline and effort and needs more time commitment and collaborations. Craftsmanship involves skilled handiwork, emphasizing precision and artistic expression. DIYers take on tasks independently, often centered around home improvement or personal projects. In contrast, being a maker extends beyond these definitions. Makers embrace a diverse range of skills and technologies, incorporating traditional craftsmanship with modern tools like 3D printers and electronics. The maker ethos emphasizes collaboration and community, with makerspaces serving as hubs for shared resources and knowledge. While a hobbyist may indulge in crafting, and a DIYer seeks self-reliance, being a maker encompasses a broader and more contemporary approach, fostering a culture of creativity, innovation, and communal learning. In essence, being a maker can encompass elements of being a hobbyist, engaging in craftsmanship, and embracing a DIY ethos, but it goes beyond these terms by emphasizing a diverse set of skills, tools, and a collaborative community. Maker is a curious person who is eager to explore new fields and experience new techniques in order to transform the interacted environment by creative and productive processes and share all those in the community that he/she collaborates with. 1.3. What is a makerspace? \u00b6 In his book \u201cThe Great Good Place,(1989)\u201d Ray Oldenburg contends that third spaces play a crucial role in promoting civil society, democracy, civic engagement, and cultivating a strong sense of place. The third space can foster inclusivity, supporting a sense of belonging and connecting citizens to each other, communities, and cities through specific characteristics. These include being a neutral ground, where participants are not bound financially, politically, or legally and have no obligation to come and go; acting as a leveler, with socioeconomic status playing no role in acceptance; prioritizing conversation as the main activity in a playful atmosphere, avoiding tension; ensuring accessibility and accommodation; relying on regulars to set the mood and attract newcomers; maintaining a low profile with a horizontal hierarchy and cozy environment accepting of all individuals; and offering a home away from home, providing participants with a comfortable space similar to home. Even though Oldenburg\u2019s book doesn\u2019t directly discuss them, makerspaces, as contemporary examples of third space, embody the main principles of the third space concept, especially in the context of social interaction, community building, innovation, creativity, and accessibility. Basically, makerspaces are collaborative environments that provide tools and resources for individuals to create, innovate, and share ideas. In line with the concept of third space theory, David Gauntlett, in his book \u201cMaking is Connecting\u201d (2011), associates making and makerspaces with the idea that individuals feel more connected and engaged with the world when they actively contribute by creating things rather than just consuming. Gauntlett\u2019s perspective on making and makerspaces emphasizes active engagement, contribution, and a sense of connection, all of which resonate with the principles of third spaces, where individuals come together to participate, contribute, and build meaningful connections within communities. Therefore, makerspaces encompass both physical and social dimensions, providing participants with tools and knowledge while fostering connections with communities.\u201d Additionally, makerspaces are community-base productive places that provide workshop places with tools, equipments and knowledge on design, crafts, manufacturing techniques, technology, and various skills on fabrication to non-professionals in order to support innovation and entrepreneurship in society through co-making and co-producing in communities. Fablabs, hacker-spaces, product libraries/library of things, co-working and co-making spaces, community gardens, bio-construction sites, and decentralized creative hubs are examples of makerspaces. While these spaces may vary in ownership, membership structure, and specific focuses, they share a common commitment to providing \u2018tools and knowledge for people.\u2019 Furthermore, Adrian Smith approaches makerspaces from a sociological perspective, emphasizing their social innovation potential in his 2017 article \u201cSocial Innovation, Democracy, and Makerspaces.\u201d Smith delves into how makerspaces contribute to social innovation by fostering collaborative, community-driven solutions. He argues that these spaces empower citizens to actively engage in the innovation process, democratize technology, and address societal challenges. Smith\u2019s approach involves examining the social impact and democratic potential of makerspaces, revealing their role beyond technical innovation and into broader community development. However, Smith critically highlights issues such as consumerism, marketization, enclosure, intellectual property problems, social, gender, and demographic imbalances, and limited impact on structural change. Overall, Adrian Smith characterizes makerspaces as innovative spaces with a complex history, framed simultaneously as agents of social transformation, valuable educational tools, and promising environments for entrepreneurship. In summary, a makerspace is a collaborative and communal workspace that provides individuals -especially non-professionals-, often referred as makers, with the tools, knowledge, some resources, and place to create, experiment, and innovate. Makerspaces are equipped with various technologies, ranging from traditional tools to digital fabrication equipments like 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and robot arms. They serve as hubs for interdisciplinary collaboration, where individuals from diverse backgrounds, such as technology, design, and craftsmanship, can come together to work on projects, share knowledge, and learn new skills. Makerspaces embody the principles of hands-on learning and community engagement, fostering a culture of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. 1.4. The maker movement \u00b6 The Maker Movement is a social and cultural phenomenon that emphasizes the creation of physical objects as a way to empower individuals, foster innovation, and encourage a hands-on, do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to learning. It is characterized by a community of individuals who share a passion for creating things and often involves the use of technology, open-source hardware, and collaborative spaces.The Maker Movement gained momentum in the early 2000s, inspired by the ethos of hacker and DIY cultures. Influences can be traced back to earlier movements like the Homebrew Computer Club in the 1970s and the early days of personal computing. The rise of the open-source software movement and the availability of information on the internet also played a crucial role in fostering the Maker Movement. Platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi became popular, providing accessible hardware for enthusiasts to experiment with. Additionally, manufacturing tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines, become affordable. By this way, individuals are able to turn their ideas into physical prototypes more easily. Finally, the new educational approach which is called hands-on, learning contributed to the popularity of making and maker movement in schools and universities. Maker Movement gets ahead community collaboration. Makers often share knowledge, resources, and projects through makerspaces, local and international events and online platforms. Makers and DIYers play a role in creating and modifying objects actively, and often using readily available tools and materials. In line with these they also embrace and support open source principles by sharing knowledge, design processes, results which encourage collaboration and the improvement of existing projects. Another characteristic of the maker movement is its interdisiplinary nature; Makers generally have diverse backgrounds, including technology, arts, crafts, engineering, design, which promotes exchange of ideas. In line with this approach, in his work Chris Anderson(2012) also explains the main features of the Maker Movement, centering predominantly on digital technologies intertwined with the movement\u2019s cultural ethos. Firstly, people uses digital desktop tools to craft designs for innovative products and subsequently create prototypes. Secondly, an established cultural practice to share the design and production processes and collaborate with others in online communities (supporting open source). And thirdly, using standardized design file formats enables individuals, at their creations, to submit their designs to commercial manufacturing services for production in any quantity. This significantly shortens the journey from conceptualization to production, mirroring the transformative impact the Web had on the dissemination of information and software. \u201cMake magazine, which I founded in 2005, harkens back to the magazines that hit their peak in the mid-20 th century, such as Popular Mechanics, which had the attitude, \u2018if it\u2019s fun, why not do it?\u2019. Such publications often helped people to start a hobby and learn new skills. Moreover, they helped the new hobbyist find a community of like-minded tinkerers to share ideas and experiences with. Maker Faire, which started in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2006, expanded this idea of learning and community and created a space where readers of the magazine could get together. At the faire, a maker could put an object they created up on a table and have people ask them about it. Having that kind of conversation with a range of people is the essence of the magazine, and of the whole movement.\u201d (Dale Dougherty, 2012, p.12) Maker Magazine and Maker Faire, founded by Dale Dougherty, have had a profound impact on the Maker Movement, contributing significantly to its growth, visibility, and community building. Launched in 2005, MAKE Magazine served as a crucial publication that showcased a wide array of DIY projects, hacks, and the maker culture. It became a central platform for sharing innovative ideas and practical tutorials, inspiring individuals to embrace hands-on creativity. Maker Faire, initiated in 2006, further propelled the movement by organizing large-scale events where makers from diverse backgrounds could exhibit their creations. These events not only brought the maker culture into the mainstream but also provided a physical space for enthusiasts to connect, collaborate, and share their passion for making. Maker Faire, with its vibrant and diverse showcases, played a pivotal role in fostering a sense of community and encouraging the collaborative spirit that defines the Maker Movement today. Together, Maker Magazine and Maker Faire have played instrumental roles in popularizing the maker ethos, inspiring creativity, and establishing a global community of makers. While Maker Faire and Maker Magazine played a crucial role in popularizing and catalyzing the Maker Movement, it\u2019s essential to note that the movement itself had early roots and influences before the inception of both. Certainly, there are some other factors, events, movements, developments that we need to consider in order to understand the maker movement better. I will provide a brief overview of the evolution of making, highlighting key movements and insights spanning from the 19 th to the 21 st century. The Great Exhibition (1851) & Arts and Crafts Movement (Late 19 th to Early 20 th Century); Within the social environment of England during the early stages of industrial revolution The Great Exhibition event gave an opportunity to show to the public how everyday objects/tools were manufactured. This raised an awareness about the production and manufacturing techniques, the backstages of the shops and stories of everyday objects. The exhibition\u2019s emphasis on industrial progress sparked a reaction against mass-produced, standardized goods. Individuals began to value craftsmanship and unique, handmade items, setting the stage for a shift towards a more individualistic and artisanal approach which were the first inspirations of the DIY culture. In line with \u201cThe Great Exhibition\u201d event, the arts and crafts movement, that was a reaction to the negative impacts of industrialisations and the comparatively low standing of the decorative arts, celebrated handmade goods and the skilled artisans who created them, emphasizing the connection between the creator and the crafted object. In summary, \u201cThe Great Exhibition\u201d and the Arts and Crafts Movement influenced the Maker Movement by inspiring a return to craftsmanship, individual creativity, and a rejection of mass production.While the direct link between The Great Exhibition and the Maker Movement may not be overt, the exhibition\u2019s impact on industrialization, technological innovation, and changing attitudes toward craftsmanship set the stage for a renewed appreciation for hands-on creativity and a return to individualized, artisanal approaches to making. The Maker Movement, with its emphasis on DIY culture, innovation, and craftsmanship, reflects a contemporary echo of the questions and values raised during the time of The Great Exhibition. Bauhaus school and Movement (1919-1933); Bauhaus was a design school that started to operate in 1919 in Germany and continued till 1933. (based in Weimar until 1925, Dessau through 1932, and Berlin in its final months) Beyond being a design school, Bauhaus is a movement and a strong, long-lasting design principle. This is the case that occurred by the very well organized, executed and developed educational curriculum and structure which combined arts and crafts with technology. Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus, aimed to built an inclusive community for artists and crafts people through the education methodology in the Bauhaus School. In order to achieve this, the educational programs focused on collaborations of teachers and students with the public and industry. This cooperation philosophy helped to school to become a trend that was influenced by not only arts and crafts but also modernism and constructivism and a long-lasting design principle. Later on, these cooperations expanded to the industrialisation by working on mass production. Workshop practices of the Bauhaus school became the core of the educational structure and encouraged the students to craftsmanship a lot and were transformed into manufacturies that were another kind of executing and connecting with the public. This transformation can be taken as a model of todays makerspaces and the makerspace movements. Walter Gropius (1883 \u20131969) was a German - American architect and founder of the Bauhaus School. Gropius managed the Bauhaus as its director until 1928. Do-It-Yourself Movement (1960s); Do-it-Yourself(DIY) is making, building, repairing or modifying things/projects without any support from an expert or a professional. The DIY as a term and ideology appeared with the home improvement and maintenance activities during 1910s, but became more popular and turned into a movement in 1960s. The DIY projects are designed to be realized at home or small workshops. DIY projects also need the knowledge of using practical hand-tools and machines. Even anti-consumerism was one of the main aim of the DIY movement, practical hand-tools and machines manufactures marketed DIY projects and supported the ideology a lot. While the DIY movement more focused on individualism, with the makerspace movement it turned into Do-it-with-others(DIWO) by collaborative projects in the makerspace workshops.(Hartmann & Mietznel, 2017) The DIY (Do-It-Yourself) culture of the 1960s serves as a crucial precursor to the contemporary Maker Movement, influencing its ethos and values. Rooted in countercultural movements and emphasizing self-sufficiency, the 1960s DIY culture initially focused on hands-on practices and a rejection of mainstream consumerism. As technology became more accessible, the DIY movement evolved to incorporate electronics and emerging technologies, with enthusiasts engaging in hacking and modifications. The open-source and collaborative spirit inherent in the 1960s DIY culture became a cornerstone of the Maker Movement, where makers openly share knowledge, designs, and project details. The DIY culture\u2019s emphasis on empowerment, individual creativity, and a shift from consumerism to active creation resonates strongly in the Maker Movement, which builds upon these principles while expanding its scope to include advanced technologies and collaborative community spaces. In essence, the DIY culture laid the foundation for the Maker Movement, shaping its approach to technology, innovation, and the celebration of hands-on creativity. Both share a fundamental belief in the power of individuals to shape and create their own technological and creative destinies. Hackerspace movement and open-source concept; Hackerspaces, also known as makerspaces or fab labs, are community-centric spaces where individuals gather to share tools, knowledge, and resources. These physical spaces provide a collaborative environment for makers to work on projects. Hackerspaces provide access to diverse tools, from traditional hand tools to digital fabrication equipment as 3D printers and CNC machines. This accessibility lowers barriers to entry and offers makers to experiment with technologies they do not have at home. Furthermore, the community-base nature of hackerspaces encourage collaboration and sharing. By peer to peer learning, makers can learn from each other, collaborate on projects, and access a diverse range of expertise within the community. Thus, experimental and free environment of hackerspaces foster innovation and iteration. Makers can explore new ideas, overcome challenges, and develope projects with the community support. In agreement with hackerspace movement, open-source concepts, rooted in transparency and collaboration, have significantly influenced the Maker Movement. The concept of open source promotes the sharing of knowledge and project documentation. Makers freely share their designs, code, and detailed instructions, contributing to a collective pool of resources and facilitating learning within the community. Additionally, the concept democratizes technology by making it more accessible and its iterative nature aligns with the iterative approach of makers. Projects are continually improved upon, and the collaborative feedback loop encourages innovation and refinement. Both the Hackerspace movement and open-source concepts boost the collaborative and community-based characteristics of the Maker Movement. Makerspaces provide physical spaces for collaboration, whereas open source promotes the sharing of recources and knowledge. Democratization of technology is the consequence of the combination of both movements that makers with diverse backgrounds can access tools, learn new skills, and play significant role in technological innovation. In essence, the hackerspace movement and open-source concepts also contributed the collaborative, accessible, and innovative culture of the Maker Movement. Critics on makerspaces and maker movement? Critics of makerspaces and the Maker Movement have focused on various topics, highlighting both the potential difficulties and the societal implications of these creative environments. While Daryl Koehn offers criticism regarding the Maker Movement\u2019s lack of diversity, its origins, and its future trajectory, highlighting concerns about the maker culture\u2019s failure to adopt an inclusive stance for all individuals in his article \u201cThe Ethics of the Maker Movement: The Potentially Good and the Possibly Terrible\u201d(2015), Minka Stoyanova (2017) mainly highlighted the demographic, social and gender imbalances in the makerspaces. On the other hand, Adrian Smith, in his 2017 article \u201cSocial Innovation, Democracy, and Makerspaces\u201d, highlights the varied concerns raised by critics of makerspaces regarding these creative environments. The focus is on institutional developments and the potential drawbacks associated with their increasing popularity. One major critique revolves around makerspaces\u2019 tendency to fixate on object production and oversimplify complex social challenges through prototyping, emphasizing the necessity for a more nuanced approach to broader social transformation. Another area of concern is the commercialization of the maker movement, where initiatives like Make magazine and Maker Faires are perceived as showcases for consumer tools, materials, and kits, supporting a new form of consumerism. Criticisms also extend to makerspace organizations receiving sponsorship from corporations and government agencies with questionable social responsibility records, raising questions about co-option and the compromise of grassroots autonomy. Moreover, concerns are raised about new forms of exploitation in maker-related design and fabrication platforms, potentially encroaching on open design principles. In response, there is a growing interest in cooperative models and public funding for more open-ended makerspaces, but persistent social imbalances and demographic disparities highlight ongoing challenges in achieving inclusivity and transformative social innovations within these creative spaces. Despite these criticisms, there are ongoing efforts within the maker community to address these concerns, including exploring cooperative models, promoting inclusivity, and advocating for public funding that aligns with social goods and sustainable development goals. The debates surrounding makerspaces and the Maker Movement highlight the complex interplay between creativity, technology, and societal impacts. So far, makerspaces have made significant progress, evolving from their earlier stages as \u2018tools for everyone\u2019 to becoming hubs for technology literacy, accessible digital fabrication, and meaningful social production. Moving forward, in order to ensure the sustainability of both new and existing makerspaces in the era of technology and artificial intelligence, there should be some development plans. Without such a plan, like 95% of startups and small businesses, they might share the same destiny of being erased from the system. 1.5. Case Study; Mapping and Analysing the Structure of Makerspaces in Barcelona \u00b6 1.5.1 Atlas of Makerspaces/Mapping Methodology/Makerspace ID Cards \u00b6 This case study involves analyzing five makerspaces with varying scales, contents, sustainability models, community engagements, and management plans. While makerspaces are commonly associated with digital fabrication, emergent technologies, and technological literacy, this case study also encompasses urban farming and spaces dedicated to cultivation in the urban. As various makerspaces have started to work on projects related to sustainable food production and agriculture this makes sense for the case study. These final informations were gathered through a series of interviews, with outcomes predominantly derived from active participation in events, workshops, multiple visits, volunteering, and studying within these makerspaces and projects. During the literature review and advisory sessions with Santi Fuentemilla, the Future Learning Lead at Fab Lab BCN, we explored the identity cards of machines in Fab Lab BCN. This exploration inspired me to extend the concept to the creation of identity cards for various makerspaces. In my search for a suitable method to design these identity cards, I attended a makers gathering known as the \u2018Network of Productive & Collaborative Spaces in Barcelona\u2019 at MakerConvent. This experience highlighted the significance of documentation for improvement and how digital tools can support this process. Although the meeting was conducted in Catalan and primarily involved physical tools and materials, I didn\u2019t leave with tangible resources except for a few photos. Consequently, I decided to create a miro board to develop identity cards for each makerspace that I intended to focus on. At this stage, I contemplated options to involve my guests in the creation process of identity cards during interviews. The first lecture of MDEF, titled \u2018Atlas of Weak Signals,\u2019 aimed at helping participants build and enhance their personal design space throughout the MDEF journey. This lecture served as inspiration, prompting me to initiate the development of a set of cards named \u2018Atlas of Makerspaces.\u2019 These cards were intended to facilitate the construction of identity cards for each makerspace, making the interview process more engaging and meaningful compared to a basic question-and-answer session. To establish a structured approach for conducting interviews, I recognized the need for a mapping system. After analyzing the components of makerspaces, I designed a connection and relation map applicable to every makerspace. This mapping divided makerspace components into three main groups: domain, physical space, and community, each with its own sub-categories. The \u2018domain\u2019 category, for instance, included subcategories such as impact, motivation, ideology, activities, sustainability model, challenges, scale, hierarchy, accessibility, and network. The \u2018physical space\u2019 category encompassed components like machines, tools and equipment, techniques, and materials. Lastly, the \u2018community\u2019 category comprised collaborators, participants, executers, supporters, and guests. Furthermore, I expanded the set of cards to support each category based on my experiences and observations during my visits, participations, volunteerings to various makerspaces. As part of the collaborative process, during MDEF01, I encouraged collaborators to create additional cards if deemed necessary. This iterative approach allowed the card set to evolve and improve with increased use. While I have conducted only five interviews thus far, continued usage is expected to contribute to further enhancements. \u201cThe necessity of keywords and visualization to attack the attention, reach more people and get more feedbacks\u201d While the power of words, sentences, and paragraphs is undeniable, we find ourselves in an era where time is a precious commodity, especially when contemplating complex subjects. ChatGPT widely used for summarizing every single article. The primary concept behind analyzing makerspaces through identity cards is to craft a visual representation with easily digestible keywords that capture attention at a glance. Undoubtedly, further detailed work is required to enhance the design. Nonetheless, the current approach adequately lays the groundwork for structuring the idea and mapping the connections and relations among makerspaces. Through this case study, I selected five makerspaces with various scale, content, ideology, sustainability model, accesiblity, and community engagement plan. There makerspaces are; AKASHA Hub: A creative hub with decentralized, and self-managed community MakerConvent: A makerspace focuses on tech literacy among young individuals and retirees Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines : A library of things and platform that connects self-employed professionals and locals Fab Lab BCn: A research and education center focuses on digital fabrication Bioma/ConnectHort: A local community garden and center of bio-construction research. 1.5.2 AKASHA Hub \u00b6 \u201dWe are a community that believes in continuous improvement, transparency, collaboration, and our independence as a symbol of resilience, intellectual freedom and action. That is why we prefer to generate our own economic income, in order to reinvest them in the project, in its infrastructure and in its community\u201d AKASHA Hub is a community based alternative project that supports the social innovation through co-making, co-creativity, materialization of ideas, and experimentation. Social innovation is the fundamental motivation and impact since its establishment. As Carmen Tanaka mentioned during the interview \u201cAKASHA Hub is a non-profit association and they are trying to build a diverse, decentralized, and self-managed community which is interdisciplinary, independent within the self-financed structure. They are working to offer innovative solutions to citizens and to the neighborhood so that they have resources and models to build, improve or create together a sustainable society.\u201d The horizontal hierarchy of the structure and different membership options promote the accessibility of the project. Consequently, the project can empower the social innovation supported by creativity, productivity, collaboration, environmental sustainability, and technology literacy. Additionally, the diversity of AKASHA Hub members, their professions, backgrounds and experience, makes each contribution of knowledge unique, valuable and differential, which leads to create actions-projects with a local focus and with global impact. Akasha-Hub is a new model for a productive and creative co-working community. It provides an alternative creative space with its 2 warehouses, to 38 residents and 600+ members. AKASHA Hub looking for collaborations in social causes, creating innovative projects focused on a sustainable, green and conscious city-society since 2017. In order to achieve this goal, they generated, designed, hosted, and organized a variety of projects and events to showcase their contributions to their community, neighborhood, and the city of Barcelona. Off Topic Films, Urban Planting Project, Geo-Llum, Hub Networks, and Green City Lab are some of the major projects that Akasha-Hub distributed. So far, Akasha did not get any European Union funds or support from the central or local governments. But, Green City Lab is a special project that Akasha community designed and developed and got the support from public (Cuerpo Europeo de Solidaridad and Ajuntament de Barcelona) fro the first time. Green City Lab is a big scale project which provides residency to some participants, provides space, knowledge, and opportunities for refugees.In short, the primary objective of the project is to build the New Model of the Urban Garden of El Clot. However, it also serves as a perfect showcase for the diverse approaches of AKASHA Hub in terms of project variety, structure, and community engagement. While one of the warehouse mostly used as a co-working space which is quite hybrid, also used for experiments, events and getherings, the second warehouse provides a space with traditional hand tools, machines and with limited digital fabrication tools to the makers and manufacturers who wants to build and produce some goods. Akasha has a solid plan to buy a CNC machine to support the manufacturing activities more in the near future. Furthermore, they are also trying a new model of management structure which is called Smart-Trust to make things more accessible and processes easier. Carmen described this way as a new model of community engagement and to let the members more participative and responsive in the Hub. Smart-trust is a part of self-management that AKASHA Hub uses to maintain the decentralized projects that distributed. In sum, AKASHA Hub is a decentralized project and a self-managed community, with its main node in Barcelona. A community with diverse professional profiles that connect people, projects and agents to generate sustainable ideas, find possibilities for innovation and develop new models of local society and applicable gloablly. Key Words; Alternative, interdisciplinary, independent, self-financed, flexible membership options, self-managed, smart trust, social innovation 1.5.3 MakerConvent \u00b6 \u201cSeeing the potential of maker movement, there is a strong popularization of \u201cmanufacturing and digital manufacturing\u201d as a form of practical learning, entrepreneurship and the promotion of STEAM thinking. This wave of interest puts the focus on makerspaces and spaces related to digital manufacturing. Schools, cities, universities, libraries\u2026 this new model of spaces suddenly appears everywhere\u201d MakerConvent is a makerspace founded by Oscar Mart\u00ednez Ciur\u00f3 in 2011. Oscar, who holds various titles and has diverse interests, can be broadly described as a cultural educator. In one of our conversations, he expressed a consistent interest in alternative education methods, particularly for young individuals. After encountering 3D printers several years ago, he foresaw the future of manufacturing and production. This led him to concentrate on digital fabrication techniques, making the establishment of a makerspace an unavoidable project at that time. Oscar referred to MakerConvent as a creative hub and education center with a significant influence on tech literacy and local social interactions. In order to do so, Oscar invested a lot of time, energy to this project. His primary emphasis is on inspiring young individuals to engage with maker culture, particularly those who may lack motivation for conventional and traditional educational approaches. MakerConvent has, to date, distributed long term education projects for youths related to making that also include digital fabrication. Oscar set MakerConvent within the direction of the \u201cCentre Civic Convent Sant Agusti\u201d. He took the advantage of EU fundings through the municipality for the establishment but donations were accepted as well especially for the tools, equipments and machines. MakerConvent is a project inspired by FabLabs but socially more open for local communities. Moreover, MakerConvent positions itself within \u201cCritical Making\u201d that combines creation with critical reflection on technology in everyday life. In Critical Making, the act of creating is considered a form of critical reflection, a pedagogical practice that evokes and provokes socially critical attitudes through creation. There is a horizontal hierarchy at MakerConvent, where peer-to-peer knowledge serves as the primary learning method. The community emphasizes learning by doing, sharing, giving, enjoying, exchanging, and participating. The space is inclusive and welcomes participants across a wide demographic range. MakerConvent not only focuses on young individuals but also strives to enhance tech literacy among retirees. Moreover, they conduct workshops on traditional production techniques such as sewing, carpentry, and screen printing. Despite not being very large, the space is well-organized and accommodates various activities simultaneously. Oscar mentioned that the size of the space imposes limitations on participation. Additionally, dealing with bureaucracy from local authorities, maintaining and nurturing the community surrounding the makerspace, staying updated, and being able to address the community\u2019s needs are the primary challenges faced by MakerConvent. \u201cDo. just do This is the key.\u201d At MakerConvent making is central to what it means to be human. There is a unique feeling about doing physical things. But, first of all, we have to learn how to do. Always try to learn more about what we build. Then, we need to have access to the right tools to be able to do and maker tools have never been cheaper, easier to use, or more powerful as today. Also, we have to be playful with what is being done, and we will be surprised, excited and proud of what we discover. Additionally, sharing is highly recommended what we have done and what we know how to do with others is the method by which the feeling of a maker is achieved in its entirety. So, this is a movement, and it requires emotional, intellectual, economic, political and institutional support. The best hope for improving the world comes from doing, and we are responsible for making a better future in MakerConvent. In order to achieve so, through several collaboration with other makerspaces in Barcelona and also various EU projects MakerConvent looks for the link between creation and empowerment, critical attitude and citizenship. Key Words; Critical making, playfully produce, do-share/give-learn-exchange-join in-support, digital fabrication, young individuals, tech-literacy, local social interactions, creative hub 1.5.4 Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines \u00b6 \u201cWe are the association CERCA (Communities, Tools and Resources at Ancient District), a group of people with a community and territorial perspective, which promotes the culture of sharing, the reuse of materials and the local economy\u201d Although they refer to themselves as a library of local objects and professional services, Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines (CdEF) is a small-scale makerspace. Daniel Pardo, an ecological activist, coordinator, learner, one of the co-founder of the project, successfully manages the space. Despite the size of the space limiting participation in each event held for the project, as Daniel mentioned during our meetings, their persistent decision on the location of the space, which is in the old quarter and has direct access from the street, supports both visibility and accessibility of the makerspace in the neighborhood. The initial concept of establishing a product library to improve the local people\u2019s lives by sharing tools, equipment, and machines emerged in 2014. However, the process of drafting a project proposal to secure EU funds through the municipality took some time. In 2019, they made a second attempt and successfully obtained support from the municipality. Then, as Daniel mentioned, \u2018the pandemic happened all of a sudden.\u2019 Despite the unexpected challenge, they persevered. They managed to find a location with direct street access, enhancing the organization\u2019s visibility and accessibility, as mentioned earlier. They seized the opportunity to situate themselves in the heart of the old town in Barcelona. Ecological activism is one of the main motivation for this project. That\u2019s why in CdEF, they are trying to build a community around the idea of \u201crepair, reuse, and share\u201d against consumerism. In order to do so, first of all they are providing several tools, equipments, and machines. Locals can borrow them by visiting the space physically. All the tools and informations on their availabilities can be checked through their website www.einesifeines.org . Membership is needed to borrow any item and a symbolic fee is necessary for registration. They are funded by municipality and accepting donations of things for product library. In parallel, the registration fees are taken as donations and there is not a fixed price for that. Thus, to support the idea \u201cSharing resources extends their useful life and reduces waste production\u201d they are managing a basic system that is completely inclusive and accessible. \u201cWhy do we need large agencies when there is someone in the neighborhood who can do it?\u201d Additionally, at CdEF, they actively organize workshops to foster a sense of community around the makerspace. These workshops serve as a platform connecting individuals seeking services with independent professionals and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that offer them. The primary motivations for participation include reforming, repairing, sharing knowledge, seeking advice, and fostering collaboration. Notably, the organization operates without a hierarchical structure, making it easy for researchers like us in MDEF/IAAC to gain a first person perspective and engage in design within the communities. Unlike tool borrowing, workshop participation does not require membership, promoting inclusivity. Workshop announcements are disseminated through both their website and physical posters placed around the neighborhood, ensuring outreach to diverse communities. Beside the workshops, at CdEF they offer a platform to contact the self-employed professionals and SMEs with the locals. With this service, they facilitate the neighborhood\u2019s access to quality services, promote the local and small-scale economy and strengthen community ties in the neighborhood. As CdEF is a small-scale makerspace that is still growing, they may not currently have access to a comprehensive range of tools. However, the absence of digital fabrication tools does not hinder them from organizing and offering workshops related to tech subjects such as coding and robotics. Collaborators can source the required tech-tools from other makerspaces. Furthermore, Caixa directly collaborates with MakerConvent for various projects, including a Robotics workshop organized by researchers for young individuals. On the other hand, as Daniel shared, they have faced challenges since the beginning, including gaining recognition, financial aspects, and dealing with bureaucracy. Nevertheless, they are experiencing growth, currently having 10-15 collaborators and acquiring over 300 members within three years. Due to space limitations, Daniel mentioned that they primarily advertise workshops within the neighborhood but are open to participation from anywhere. In an ideal scenario, Daniel envisions a product library for each neighborhood becoming a mainstream movement supported by local governments. They are open to collaborations to realize this goal, aiming to raise awareness of ecological sustainability and foster connections between self-employed professionals and SMEs with the local community on a citywide scale.

Gershenfeld emphasizes the idea that everyone is inherently a maker, capable of creating and fabricating things. The concept of Fab Labs, which Gershenfeld pioneered, involves creating community spaces equipped with digital fabrication tools, where people can come together to learn, collaborate, and bring their creative projects to life. Fab Lab Barcelona is a research and education centre that mostly focuses on digital fabrication and technology which will shape our way of living, working, and discovering in cities. Fab Lab organizations are among the most important pioneers of the maker movement. Fab Lab BCN, founded in 2007, holds the distinction of being the first Fab Lab established in the European Union. It was a cosmic encounter moment that Tomas Diez, Shane Salisbury, and Victor Vina met with Neil Gershenfeld -a professor at MIT/computer scientists and physicist- and with the housing and technologic support of the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) they founded the Fab Lab BCN. Fab Labs are large-scale maker organizations executed by tech experts connected to a powerful network of over 1800 Fab Labs in over 100 countries. At Fab Lab BCN, experts engage in research projects such as Smart Citizen, DIY 3D Printers, Making Sense, MakeIt, Grow, Centrino, FoodShift. On the other hand, in collaboration with partners, they provide educational programs such as the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF). The lab also incubates projects like Fab Academy, Green Fab Lab, Fab City, and Fab Textiles. The primary motivation and impact of these projects are innovation through tech literacy, support for local communities and the economy, and the use of technological infrastructures to enhance daily life standards in urban areas. Additionally, their educational programs incorporate design methodologies that include public and social participation. As an alumnus of IAAC and Fab Lab BCN, I had the opportunity to experience and witness many processes. Additionally, I conducted an interview with Guillem Camprodo -Executive Director- to gather his insights and share details about the experience. Guillem mentioned that, although it was a significant advantage that IAAC shared space and digital fabrication tools with Fab Lab BCN for the establishment, it posed a challenge to gain recognition and establish a sustainability plan for Fab Lab BCN independent of IAAC. Until that time, the research and development processes/activities were primarily distributed and financed by global companies and well-known universities. This was not the conventional approach, especially in Europe, for working on innovative possibilities among independent labs. In order to gain recognition, they organized many events included the young individuals and developed projects to attended well-known events as Hyperhabitat at Venice Biennale. Additionally, they organized the first Exhibition about 3D Printing in Barcelona, and they run a Fab Lab at the Design Museum. Furthermore, maintaining a reasonable level of hierarchy to provide personal space and freedom for innovation became another challenge as the staff grew. Guillem also emphasized that this challenge is not unique to Fab Lab BCN but is shared by all makerspaces. While makerspaces have grown by providing digital fabrication tools and knowledge for individual and communal production, the focus now shifts to developing sustainable plans for the future. The question arises: What will be the development and sustainability plan for each makerspace to continue existing as a valuable contribution to the communities?\u201d Then, he quickly suggested that there should be some transitions and new coalitions to build new structures for communities in order to share knowledge, spaces, tools and support innovation. \u201cOur mission at Fab Lab Barcelona is to provide access to the tools, knowledge and means to educate, innovate and invent using technology and digital fabrication to allow anyone to make (almost) anything.\u201d Based on my experiences, Fab Lab BCN provides access to a wide array of tools, enabling participants to create almost anything. Digital fabrication tools, including a robotic arm, are readily accessible. While there isn\u2019t an injection molding opportunity, makers can engage in discussions about alternative production/manufacturing methods to bring their plans to life. The space offers traditional production techniques, often combined with digital fabrication tools. The staff comprises experts who willingly share their knowledge when needed. The fostering of a collective mindset, sharing, constructive feedback, and open communication are highly valued to improve making skills. Unlike some Fab Labs that have open days for local makers to access the space and facilities, Fab Lab BCN is an exclusive maker space. Training programs come at a cost. At first glance, this might seem contradictory to the ethos of the maker movement, but several considerations, such as security, organization, and regulations, must be taken into account when hosting guests in a large-scale organization like Fab Lab BCN. On the other hand, Fab Lab BCN is open to other local communities and makerspaces working in innovative fields. They host numerous events and collaborations, both locally and internationally. However, sharing the space and tools with IAAC is another factor limiting public access. \u201cLocally productive, globally-connected cities, Barcelona became the first city to sign up to the challenge to produce everything the city consumes by 2054. Fab Lab Barcelona, alongside IAAC and Barcelona City Council are collaborating locally to implement new models through interventions in governance and policy.\u201d In summary, Fab Lab BCN is a large-scale maker space organization that serves as a driving force within the global maker movement. Functioning as both a research and education center, it designs, conducts, and supports various projects. This goes beyond merely providing digital manufacturing technologies and tools for prototyping; it involves hosting events, supporting collaborations, and fostering alternative maker and grower communities, both locally and globally. All of these efforts align with the overarching goal of working towards environmentally sustainable futures and locally productive communities. Key words; Large scale makerspace, driving force of maker movement, digital fabrication, distributed maker communities, research and education center, sustainability, make almost anything 1.5.6 Bioma-ConnectHort \u00b6 BIOMA project in Barcelona, which was formerly known as ConnectHort stands for \u201cBarcelona Institute of Organic Market Gardeners\u201d (in Catalan: \u201cBarcelona Institut d\u2019Oficis de la Pagesia Ecol\u00f2gica\u201d), and it aims to promote sustainable agriculture, particularly organic farming, within the city. The project provides training and support for urban farmers and promotes the consumption of locally grown organic produce. It\u2019s part of Barcelona\u2019s broader efforts to promote urban sustainability and resilience through initiatives such as urban agriculture and local food production. They also host some communities that work on bio-construction and related materials workshops to contribute other communities. The phrase \u201cFood is the new internet\u201d suggests a comparison between the transformative impact of the internet on various aspects of life and the potential for a similar transformation in the food industry. It implies that innovations, technologies, and changes in the way we produce, distribute, and consume food could have a revolutionary impact, similar to how the internet has transformed communication, information access, and various industries. The concept often relates to advancements in areas like sustainable agriculture, food tech, and alternative food sources, emphasizing the potential for positive change and disruption in the food sector. Consequently, I had decided to include Bioma(An urban community garden and bio-construction project) as a part of makerspace movement. Community gardens are, in my opinion, essential in urban spaces to maintain a connection with the soil and agriculture, especially for younger generations. In many metropolitan cities, younger people believe that food is automatically produced by chain supermarkets\u2019 shelves, leading to a lack of awareness about production processes and resulting in significant food waste. The Bioma project began in 2013 under the name ConnectHort. The community organization decided to transform the land, previously occupied by a building in Barcelona\u2019s old industrial area, into a community garden. The land is owned by the municipality, and the Bioma community occasionally needs to renew their contract for its use. Because the project relies on volunteering, there are sometimes delays in decision-making. Additionally, like most other small community gardens in Barcelona, the space is not open to the public 24/7. This limitation is a significant disadvantage for community garden projects, preventing them from becoming mainstream. Vandalism is cited as the reason for not keeping the community garden spaces open and accessible to the public around the clock. I attended the ConnectHort community garden several times as a volunteer, helping to organize the space during the spring. From community members, I learned skills and knowledge about growing vegetables and planting trees. I also met new people who came to volunteer like myself. While there isn\u2019t a strict hierarchy, orientation is necessary as volunteering is the main structure. Additionally, I contacted Sebastian Barreto, who manages the Bioma Project community, and gathered more information about their future plans. Permaculture and sustainable agriculture are the main activities in the garden, attracting a large international community. They maintain connections with other urban gardens, makerspaces, and academic institutions like IAAC, which supports the international community. Furthermore, with the help of neighbors, they produce a significant amount of compost necessary for the space and its agricultural activities. They hosted the Comida (Vertical Garden) project led by IAAC and are currently working on ongoing projects, including making cobs (sun-dried bricks) from mud and straw by guest communities, as well as organizing bio-plastic workshops. Moreover, they are exploring possible solutions to make the urban garden more open and accessible to diverse communities. The primary challenge of urban gardens in big cities is vandalism. Since urban gardens mostly rely on volunteering, ensuring safety in crowded cities can be difficult. Even in most metropolitan cities, municipalities prefer to close central parks at night for security reasons. However, this security measure reduces the accessibility of urban gardens and diminishes community diversity. It\u2019s common for urban green space initiatives to face various challenges related to land use, zoning regulations, funding, and community engagement. As Sebastian mentioned, dealing with bureaucratic processes within the Barcelona municipality, such as obtaining permits, licenses, or approvals, can be time-consuming and complex. Moreover, maintaining open and well-maintained spaces requires ongoing effort and resources. Ensuring that the space remains sustainable and accessible to the community over the long term can be another challenge. To sum up, Bioma project in Barcelona is a fascinating initiative aimed at creating a sustainable and biodiverse urban environment. It involves the development of green spaces and ecological corridors within the city to promote biodiversity, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life for residents. The project encompasses various elements such as green roofs, vertical gardens, urban parks, and tree planting initiatives, all designed to integrate nature into the urban fabric and mitigate the effects of urbanization on the environment.

This development journey, often referred to as the \u201ctransition of makerspaces,\u201d has been a dynamic and transformative process. Initially, makerspaces were simple workshops focused on digital fabrication, but they have evolved into vibrant social innovation and creative hubs deeply integrated into neighborhoods. The early makerspaces, often inspired by the Fab Lab model developed at MIT, primarily served as workshops equipped with digital fabrication tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines. These spaces aimed to provide individuals with access to advanced manufacturing technologies that were typically inaccessible to the general public at the time. But, even in the early stages, education and community-building were the key components. Fab Labs based makerspaces offered workshops and training sessions to teach members how to use the equipment and develop their technical skills. This is the key component that give the chance of evolving to a movement like the Bauhaus movement as mentioned in the previous chapters. As the maker movement grew, makerspaces began to diversify their activities beyond digital fabrication. They started to include more traditional tools and crafts, integrating activities like woodworking, metalworking, electronics, and textiles. Consequently, makerspaces increasingly became venues for collaborative projects, where individuals with different skills could come together to work on shared goals. This collaborative spirit led to the creation of innovative products and solutions, often with a focus on sustainability and community benefit. Motivated by expansion and diversification, makerspaces went beyond being just workshops for digital fabrication. Makerspaces began addressing broader social issues, such as sustainability, education, and local economic development. They became platforms for social innovation, where communities could come together to tackle local challenges. This vision shift allowed makerspaces to engage more directly with local communities. They hosted events, workshops, and programs tailored to the specific needs and interests of their communities, neighborhoods and cities, fostering a sense of ownership and participation. Consequently, makerspaces evolved into cultural and creative hubs, offering not only technical and fabrication skills but also arts, crafts, and design. They became places where creativity could flourish in various forms, supporting artistic endeavors and cultural activities. Furthermore, it is essential to mention the circular economy approach to understand the transition of makerspaces from digital fabrication workshops to social innovation and creative hubs. This evolution has been driven by the needs and opportunities within communities and urban areas, especially in big cities. Climate change, growing population, and modern consumption culture have raised the need for sustainability. As a solution and key factor in achieving a sustainable future, the concept of circular and regenerative cities was born. Many makerspaces, particularly those aiming to remain relevant and pioneer change, decided to adopt circular principles. With support from the European Union, numerous projects have been developed to realize the concept of circular and regenerative cities. In the second chapter of this framework, we will examine the transition process of makerspaces as they evolved from basic workshops focused on digital fabrication to social innovation and creative hubs fully integrated into their neighborhoods and local communities. To understand this evolution, it is necessary to explore several concepts and related projects that makerspaces have engaged in and created in response. Key components include the circular economy, waste management, redesigning artisanal practices with digital fabrication tools, the power of prototyping for development and social innovation, and community engagement, as well as building new coalitions between makers and professionals. These elements are crucial for understanding the development process of makerspaces and ensuring that the maker movement continues to evolve and remain grassroots 2.2 How Makerspaces Benefit and Support the Circular Economy? \u00b6 Throughout the development process of makerspaces, new ideas and concepts have empowered the evolution of the maker movement. To further understand this process and build upon the existing success of the maker movement, the circular economy must be taken into consideration. The circular economy is an operating model where we reduce the amount of natural resources needed and minimize waste by keeping materials in use for as long as possible. This contrasts sharply with the current linear economy, where we extract resources, manufacture items, use them, and then dispose of them in landfills. The world faces a significant waste problem, with 300 million tons of plastic disposed of each year, equivalent to the weight of the human population. Additionally, we are running out of resources. Thus, transitioning from a linear economy to a circular economy is essential for sustainability. The concept of the circular economy began gaining significant attention in the European Union (EU) around the early 2010s. Since 2011, the European Commission has published several roadmaps outlining the need for a shift towards a circular economy and action plans to promote recycling, reusability, sustainable products, and waste management practices. This concept has gained considerable traction recently, particularly among makerspaces and the maker movement. Makerspaces\u2014community workshops providing access to tools, resources, and knowledge for creation, innovation, and collaboration\u2014are uniquely positioned to support and benefit from the principles of a circular economy. As a consequence, the maker movement and the circular economy benefit and support each other mutually. As environmental concerns have grown, so has awareness and education about sustainable practices. Makerspaces often emphasize education and community learning, making them ideal for spreading knowledge about the circular economy. They align with the circular economy\u2019s focus on resource efficiency. Operating on limited budgets, makerspaces naturally maximize the use of materials and tools, a practical necessity that dovetails with circular principles. As hubs of innovation, makerspaces encourage experimentation and development of new solutions, fostering practices such as upcycling, recycling, and designing products for longevity and disassembly. The European Green Deal\u2019s circular economy action plans financially and reputationally encourage makerspaces, which, in turn, support the circular economy by their nature. Firstly, makerspaces often host repair caf\u00e9s and upcycling workshops, extending product life and reducing waste. Secondly, the maker movement is community-oriented, promoting collaboration and shared knowledge, which are vital for a circular economy\u2019s networks of sharing, repairing, and recycling. Additionally, many makerspaces embrace open-source principles, sharing designs and processes openly, leading to wider adoption of circular practices and innovative solutions replicable by others. Moreover, makerspaces often focus on local production, reducing the need for long supply chains and supporting local economies. This localism aligns with circular economy principles by minimizing transportation emissions and fostering local resource loops. Modular design and the use of sustainable materials are other important subjects the maker movement encourages for circularity. By designing products that can be easily repaired, upgraded, or recycled, makers contribute to the longevity and recyclability of items, core tenets of the circular economy. Thus, it is clear that makerspaces significantly benefit and support the circular economy through their efficient projects and practices. As a summary, if we want to make a system change towards the circular economy by putting the burden on the supplier to take responsible for the longevity of that product and to move to more service-based models rather than product ownership models there were much more likely to overcome this challenge about circularity and moving to a more economy. It is essential encouraging people to gain the confidence and skills that it\u2019s not so hard to try to repair things and to be able to demonstrate the value of the maker space and providing a safe and open and welcome environment to support people to actually repair things rather than simply dispose or recycle them. On the other hand, makerspaces should be circular because circular economy is not to have its must-have. We are using up all our natural resources and we are creating a lot of waste . The role of a makerspace can use products that are already in train and create a second life for those products. 2.2.1 Pop-Machina Project \u00b6 Within the scope of the European Commission\u2019s circular economy action plan, several projects were carried out. The Pop-Machina Project is an EU-funded initiative under the Horizon 2020 program aimed at promoting circular economy practices through the maker movement. The project supports the establishment of makerspaces in seven cities across Europe: Leuven (Belgium), Thessaloniki (Greece), Kaunas (Lithuania), Venlo (Netherlands), Piraeus (Greece), Santander (Spain), and Istanbul (Turkey). These makerspaces are designed to serve as hubs for innovation and community engagement, fostering sustainable practices at the local level. The primary goal of the Pop-Machina Project is to embed circular economy principles into local communities by leveraging the potential of makerspaces. By encouraging the reuse, repair, and recycling of materials, these spaces aim to enhance resource efficiency and reduce waste. The project also places a strong emphasis on education and awareness, offering programs that teach participants about the benefits of a circular economy and how to implement sustainable practices in their daily lives. The Pop-Machina project is significant for this framework for three main reasons. Firstly, its content is directly related to makerspace establishment. Secondly, Fab Lab BCN is one of the institutions that carried out the projects with the consortium (which includes the faculty of MDEF01 and MDEF02 and advisory of this framework). Lastly, one of the makerspaces established within the scope of the project is in Istanbul, where the author of this framework plans to establish another makerspace with the help and support of this framework and all the experiences and information gained during its preparation. Beyond these three reasons, the key aspects of the Pop-Machina project in terms of the circular economy and maker movement are quite inspiring and directive. Not only does the academic content of Pop-Machina help, but also the practical information and methodology of the seven individual and local partners that support the makerspaces in their cities provide makers with ideas on the right approach to consider the circular economy locally. Each city has a local partner carrying out the project; for example, in Istanbul, The Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul is the local partner. Furthermore, these partners share information on their local websites about the main urban problems their cities face, the lacks and opportunities within their cities, potential collaborators, and the potential impact of their projects. Overall, the Pop-Machina Project has the potential to significantly impact local communities by embedding sustainable practices and promoting a circular economy. By leveraging the power of the maker movement, it creates a more resilient and resource-efficient society. This project exemplifies how makerspaces can be harnessed to drive social innovation and sustainability, serving as a model for similar initiatives worldwide. 2.3 Makerspaces and Waste Management \u00b6 As an important component of circular economy practices, waste management should be considered in detail by the maker movement. Waste management is the process of handling waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes the collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste, as well as the monitoring and regulation of these processes. Effective waste management is essential for maintaining public health, protecting the environment, and conserving resources. Waste management is often seen as a subject for local or central governments to address, necessitating policies and regulations to manage the processes. However, waste management is fundamentally a social issue. Governments can set rules for industries, but consumers also demand more circular products. Given that waste management is a social issue, makerspaces\u2014as new innovation centers, social clubs, and creative hubs\u2014need to support the concept through projects. By fostering innovation, education, and community engagement, makerspaces can play a crucial role in waste management and the circular economy. They serve as hubs for developing and prototyping new recycling technologies and upcycling projects, turning waste into valuable products. Through workshops and training programs, makerspaces educate communities about sustainable practices and skills in repair, DIY, and sustainable design. By encouraging resource sharing and promoting circular design principles, they minimize waste and extend product lifecycles. Additionally, makerspaces support circular economy principles by hosting repair caf\u00e9s and facilitating material reuse. They contribute to research and development by piloting projects and collecting data to improve sustainability efforts. By raising awareness and influencing policy, makerspaces demonstrate the practical benefits of the circular economy, encouraging wider adoption. Examples like Precious Plastic, Repair Caf\u00e9s, Recycle Beirut, and Makerspace Adelaide highlight the impact of makerspaces in promoting waste reduction and sustainable practices. Effective waste management includes strategies such as recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy conversion. It also involves reducing waste generation through sustainable practices, reusing materials, and encouraging responsible consumption. In big cities, waste management is particularly challenging due to high population density, large volumes of waste, and the need for sophisticated infrastructure to handle different types of waste, including organic, inorganic, hazardous, and electronic waste. Comprehensive waste management systems aim to minimize landfill use, mitigate pollution, and conserve resources, contributing to a cleaner, healthier urban environment. Measuring recycling is an important aspect of waste management. This involves examining the tons of materials, classifying the waste types, and determining whether the materials are recyclable or must be sent to the landfill. Measuring waste management can be straightforward with a set of scales. However, measuring reuse and repairability is challenging and lacks standardized methods. Businesses aiming to adopt a circular economy struggle with this issue. Makerspaces can contribute by measuring their impact on waste prevention. Makerspaces attract diverse individuals, and today, many products are not circular. It is often unclear if everyday objects are repairable or recyclable, and whether repairs can be done by an average person or require a specialist. Manufacturers intentionally limit information to encourage new purchases instead of repairs. Makerspaces, as new social innovation centers, must support repair, recycle, and upcycle concepts through waste management projects, regardless of scale. Makerspaces need a framework to measure contributions to the circular economy. This includes quantifying materials or items repaired or reused, their environmental benefits (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions or water savings), and their economic value. Additionally, they must assess harder-to-measure social benefits, such as community education and instilling values of repairability, reusability, and product longevity in the next generation of designers. In order to understand deeply the support of maker movement to waste management, we need to review some global scale projects that successfully carried out by many makerspaces all around the world; 2.3.1 Precious Plastic \u00b6 The Precious Plastic project is an innovative and influential initiative that aligns closely with the principles of the circular economy and waste management. It was founded by Dutch designer Dave Hakkens in 2013 and has since grown into a global movement. The project aims to tackle plastic waste by providing tools and knowledge to individuals and communities, enabling them to recycle plastic locally and create valuable products from discarded materials. Precious Plastic project is a perfect example of open-source philosophy. All designs, blueprints, and instructional videos for building recycling machines are freely available online. This approach allows anyone, anywhere in the world, to set up their own recycling workspace and start turning plastic waste into new products. The project also provides detailed plans for constructing various DIY recycling machines, including shredder, extrusion machine, injection molder, and compression machine. Moreover, the project has created a global network of makers, recyclers, and innovators who share ideas, solutions, and support that fosters a sense of community and collective effort towards reducing plastic waste. On the other hand, each initiative teach participants about plastic recycling, sustainable practices, and the importance of reducing waste by workshops and educational programs. Consequently, the project not only diverts plastic from landfills but also demonstrates the value and potential of recycled materials by the creation of a wide variety of products, from simple items like bowls and tiles to more complex goods like furniture and art. The Precious Plastic project exemplifies how makerspaces can play a crucial role in promoting circular economy principles and effective waste management. By providing the tools, knowledge, and community support needed to recycle plastic locally, Precious Plastic empowers individuals and communities to take action against plastic pollution and contribute to a more sustainable world. 2.3.2 Recycle Beirut: \u00b6 Recycle Beirut is a notable project within the scope of the circular economy and waste management, reflecting how makerspaces can drive social and environmental innovation. Founded in response to Lebanon\u2019s severe waste management crisis, Recycle Beirut exemplifies the powerful impact that grassroots initiatives can have on local communities and ecosystems. This initiative was established in 2015 and combines waste management with social entrepreneurship. It emphasizes proper sorting at the source, educating participants on how to separate their waste into different categories such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal by operating a facility where collected materials are sorted, cleaned, and processed. As a result of the process waste transformed into raw materials that can be reintroduced into the manufacturing cycle. Another aspects of Recycle Beirut is its social mission. The project employs Syrian refugees, providing them with fair wages and safe working conditions. This approach not only addresses environmental issues but also contributes to social equity and economic development within marginalized communities. In addition to this mission, project conducts workshops, campaigns, and outreach programs to raise awareness about the importance of recycling and sustainable waste management. These efforts help build a culture of sustainability and environmental responsibility within the local community. In order to so, they used social media platforms and physical posters to share practical information about recycling. Recycle Beirut is a powerful example of how makerspaces can support and enhance circular economy and waste management efforts. By addressing both environmental and social challenges, Recycle Beirut demonstrates the multifaceted impact of grassroots initiatives. 2.3.3 Repair Cafes \u00b6 Repair Cafes are community-based workshops hosted by makerspaces where people can bring broken items to be repaired by volunteers. This project supports waste management, holds significant importance for makerspaces, and profoundly impacts the development of the maker movement by bringing people together and fostering a sense of community within makerspaces. Repair events create opportunities for social interaction, knowledge sharing, and collaborative problem-solving. Participants also learn about repair methods, gain skills, and enhance their technical abilities. This educational aspect aligns with the mission of many makerspaces to provide learning opportunities and skill development. By encouraging communities to repair rather than replace items, makerspaces actively contribute to environmental sustainability. This aligns with the broader goals of many makerspaces to foster innovative solutions to global challenges like circular cities and waste management. Repair Cafe events embody the main principles of the circular economy by keeping products in use longer, thereby reducing the need for new resources and minimizing waste. They also help to change consumer attitudes towards valuing repair over disposal, promoting more sustainable consumption patterns. While the main motivation of the Repair Cafes project\u2014to promote repair over disposal\u2014remains the same, their local implementations can vary. Factors such as community needs, available skills, resources, cultural influences, and local partnerships all play a role in shaping the specific focus and operations of Repair Cafes in different cities. For instance, while bike repair workshops are common and popular in Barcelona, Repair Cafes in Tokyo might prioritize small household items and electronics. Likewise, in economically disadvantaged areas, repair workshops might focus on essential items like kitchen appliances, ensuring that community members can maintain a basic standard of living without needing to purchase new items. This adaptability is one of the strengths of the maker movement and the Repair Cafes project, allowing it to meet the unique needs of diverse communities around the world. The significant win-win situation of the maker movement and waste management can be seen in the environmental impact and the strengthening of the maker movement. By diverting items from landfills, Repair Cafes help reduce the environmental footprint of the community. This practical impact on waste management reinforces the maker movement\u2019s commitment to sustainability. Moreover, repairing items conserves resources, aligning with the movement\u2019s values of efficiency and conservation. On the other hand, Repair Cafes can raise the profile of makerspaces and the maker movement, attracting new members and supporters. They encourage collaboration between makerspaces and other community organizations, building stronger networks for advocacy and action. To sum up, the Repair Cafes project is crucial for makerspaces because it strengthens community ties, utilizes resources efficiently, and promotes sustainability. It also impacts the maker movement by fostering innovation, reducing waste, conserving resources, raising awareness, and building a stronger, more visible network of like-minded individuals and organizations. 2.4 Power of Prototyping \u00b6 Prototyping is the process of creating an early sample or model of a product to test and validate ideas, concepts in very first place. But, the real meaning of prototyping lies in its ability to transform abstract ideas into tangible, testable models, facilitating innovation, improving designs, and accelerating development. Especially in makerspaces, prototyping allows ideas to move from the conceptual stage to a physical or digital form, making abstract concepts understandable and accessible with in the local communities, neighbourhoods and cities. Designers, developers and makers can quickly test their ideas in order to validate them and identify potential issues before investing significant time and resources by prototyping. Communities around makerspaces give feedback which is essential for developing a project by necessary revisions. That is how prototyping go beyond the sample and model of a product or idea. Prototyping is a hands-on approach encourages experimentation and innovation and allows makers to bring their ideas to life quickly and inexpensively. By testing and refining their ideas iteratively, makers are leading to more effective and creative solutions. This trial-and-error process is one of the fundamentals of the maker culture. Through the process, makers learn to troubleshoot and solve problems, which enhances their critical thinking abilities. Additionally, prototyping involves various individual and collaborative skills, such as digital fabrication tools, conventional production and manufacturing techniques, communication and observation for data collection. Learning these skills is a core part of the makerspace experience. On one side, by sharing the knowledge on freely makerspaces become creative hubs that democratize the technology and provides accessibility to the modern manufacturing techniques. On the other side, as prototyping often involves collaboration and brings people together to work on projects, it helps to build a sense of community and fosters teamwork which is another important aspect of the maker movement. Consequently, the inclusive environment of makerspaces and diverse backgrounds of participants empowers the prototyping process. Prototyping is also crucial for startup incubation. Makerspaces provide the tools and community support necessary for entrepreneurs to develop and refine their ideas and products and help to get ready for further development and make necessary adaptations. By fostering new businesses and innovations, makerspaces contribute to local economic development. They often act as incubators for new ideas that can scale up into successful companies. Prototyping in makerspaces also supports circular economy, waste management and resource efficiency. Prototyping tools and skills are often used to repair and modify existing items that supports the circular economy and reducing waste. It also leads to the development of sustainable solutions by enabling rapid testing and iteration. Makers can create more efficient products and processes by prototyping. Overall, no matter if it is a solution to a problem, a way to answer a question or to obtain information, a way to explain a much broader idea or concept prototyping is far beyond a sample or model of a product to test and validate ideas. \u201cLearning by doing\u201d or \u201chands on learning\u201d or \u201cprototyping\u201d manifest the maker culture ethos and has been a driving force behind the development and growth of makerspaces. It has fostered innovation, supported learning and skill development, built community, democratized access to technology, stimulated local economic models, promoted sustainable practices, and empower the maker culture. 2.5 Redesigning the Artisanal Practices with Digital Fabrication Tools \u00b6 As mentioned in the first chapter, the maker movement began with the Fab Lab model, which is based on digital fabrication tools and techniques. The main goal was to democratize these technologies, which were not accessible at the time. Fortunately, the maker movement continued by incorporating traditional practices and techniques -such as woodworking, metalworking, and even sewing- and by building and developing their own communities, the movement successfully became grassroots. The sharing culture in makerspaces\u2014which includes sharing space, tools, knowledge, and experiences\u2014resulted in many interactions within the communities, as most making processes require collaboration. Interactions between makers skilled in digital fabrication and practitioners knowledgeable in traditional techniques created opportunities to build hybrid platforms. As a result of these interactions, some makers and practitioners were able to redesign traditional and artisanal practices using digital fabrication tools. Redesigning artisanal practices with digital fabrication tools in makerspaces is crucial for the future of the maker movement. Firstly, integrating digital fabrication tools into traditional and daily practices makes their usage more meaningful, rather than using them for abstract and superficial projects. Secondly, rediscovering traditional techniques facilitates the exchange of significant amounts of knowledge and tips among participants. Moreover, new coalitions and alliances can be built due to the collaborative nature of the maker movement. Finally, and most importantly, the communities become increasingly diverse by building these coalitions and alliances between practitioners and makers. This diversity in maker communities is essential for grassroots development and for keeping the movement relevant and updated in the real world. Romi project, FabCityHub Barcelona and Phygital Therapy Grid(PTG) are some projects carried out by makerspaces in Barcelona as examples of redesigning the traditional practices with digital fabrication tools. 2.5.1 Romi Project \u00b6 The ROMI Project, in which Fab Lab Barcelona and the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) participated, aims to integrate robotics with farming to support sustainable, small-scale agriculture. Funded by the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 program, the project focuses on developing open-source robotic tools that help micro-farmers manage their farms more efficiently and sustainably. This initiative exemplifies the redesign of traditional practices through digital fabrication, demonstrating the concepts applicability even to agricultural practices. The primary goal of the ROMI Project is to address the challenges faced by micro-farms, promoting biodiversity and reducing reliance on artificial fertilizers and pesticides by using advanced robotics and digital tools. The project has developed several key technologies, including a mechanical weeding robot, an aerial robot for crop monitoring, and a 3D scanner for plant phenotyping in both indoor and outdoor environments. As an important makerspace, Fab Lab Barcelona contributed significantly to the ROMI Project by leveraging its expertise in digital fabrication and robotics. The lab developed and tested these robotic tools, ensuring they meet the needs of micro-farmers. Their role involved the design and construction of the robots, as well as conducting field studies to refine and validate the technology. This practical application and testing were conducted at Valldaura Labs, one of the project\u2019s key research sites. By integrating robotics into farming practices, the ROMI Project aims to save time and reduce physical labor for farmers, making small-scale agriculture more viable and appealing. This initiative supports the broader goals of sustainability and innovation in agriculture, demonstrating how digital fabrication technologies can enhance traditional farming practices. 2.5.2 FabCityHub Barcelona \u00b6 The FabCityHub Barcelona is part of a bigger vision \u2013 the Fab City model. The Fab City model has challenged Barcelona, amongst other cities in the world, to become active participants in producing everything consumed by 2054. The Project tries to use the productive potential of Poblenou neighborhood, to become locally produced and globally connected. The project demonstrates a great example to development of makerspaces. This project integrates the maker movement\u2019s principles with a broader urban strategy, emphasizing the local production of energy, food, and materials and aims to transform urban production and consumption patterns to create sustainable and resilient cities. One of the main goal is to shift from a globalized production model to a localized one, encouraging the production and consumption of goods within the city. This reduces dependency on external resources and minimizes the environmental impact associated with transportation and logistics. In order to get the achievement, it focus on circular economy principles, aiming to close the loop on resource usage. This involves recycling materials, using renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable food systems. These hubs serve as experimental grounds for developing and testing new sustainable practices that can be scaled across the city. Additinally, FabCityHub project seeks to build new collaborations across different sectors, including industry, public institutions, and the community. By involving a diverse range of stakeholders, FabCityHubs try to create a platform for innovative solutions in urban farming, energy production, and material usage. Makerspaces within the FabCityHub project are evolving into multifunctional creative hubs. These hubs not only provide access to digital fabrication tools but also foster creativity, education, and community engagement. They become centers for skill development, innovation, and cultural exchange, further enriching the urban fabric. In summary, the FabCityHub project in Barcelona aims to redefine urban production and consumption through local collaborations, sustainable practices, and the evolution of makerspaces into creative hubs. Fab Lab Barcelona and IAAC play a crucial role in this transformation, driving innovation and fostering a culture of sustainability and resilience within the city. 2.5.3 Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG) Project \u00b6 The Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG) project was created by three master\u2019s students (Ahmed Yakud, Marc Pares, \u00c7a\u011flar Alkan) within the Master in Design for Emergent Futures program during 2022-2023. The project aims to bridge the physical and digital worlds, making digital fabrication technologies easier to understand, user-friendly, and applicable to artisanal practices. So far, it has been utilized in the redesign of two traditional practices and one game concept. The team developed a system composed of a physical interface grid, a camera, and a Grasshopper-Rhinoceros based code that functions as the software. The grid serves as a base for pieces with various basic geometric shapes and cubes of different heights, enabling the creation of designs and patterns. Each cube and piece has a Fiducial ID, which is tracked by the camera through the software code in Grasshopper. Fiducial IDs function like quarcodes and are detected by the cameras. The system operates in both the physical and digital worlds. When a user creates a pattern or design on the grid in the real world, the camera tracks and replicates it into a digital version using the Grasshopper code in Rhinoceros. The PTG system has already been integrated into two artisanal practices: screen printing and hydraulic tile making. For screen printing, the desired pattern can be captured and transformed into a format suitable for a vinyl cutter using the software (.stl). The created design is then sent to a 3D printer inappropriate format(.stl) through Cura software for tile making. Accordingly, the vinyl cutter cuts the desired pattern for screen printing, and the 3D printer builds the necessary frame for the tile design. Moreover, the PTG system was also used as a game concept that supports understanding the connections between the digital and physical worlds. Mostly, cubes with various heights placed on the PTG grid were used for the game concept, and the software replicates the design simultaneously in Rhinoceros. The created design can be sent to a 3D printer and built out of filament as it is designed. This concept provides a better understanding of digital fabrication tools through rapid hands-on exercises, especially for youngsters. (../images/t9.png) The Phygital Therapy Grid system was developed with the support of Fab Lab BCN and tested within the community of Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines. Several workshops were organized, and substantial feedback was taken into consideration to advance the project. Interactions between makers, developers, and practitioners were highly beneficial and motivated both participants and project creators. In summary, the PTG project has great potential for further development and integration into many more traditional practices. It serves as an inspiring example of redesigning artisanal practices within makerspace. 2.6 Community Building and Engament to Distribute the Maker Movement and Connect Makers \u00b6 Community building and engagement play a crucial role in the maker movement and the development of makerspaces, transforming them from workshops focused on digital fabrication into creative hubs. Initially beginning with the fab lab model and expanding to include wood and metal workshops as well as sewing equipment, makerspaces have further evolved to address everyday issues such as food, agriculture, energy, and material production within urban environments. These efforts are often part of sustainable city projects. The diversity of these subjects has connected a wide range of makers, practitioners, experts, developers, and creators from different backgrounds, fostering the creation of vibrant communities around these makerspaces. According to the Fab Foundation, makerspaces thrive on the collaborative efforts of their members, where diverse skill sets and perspectives contribute to innovative solutions and projects. Community engagement fosters an environment where individuals can share ideas, troubleshoot problems, and co-create. The sharing culture within makerspaces, which includes sharing space, tools, knowledge, and experiences, results in many interactions within the community, as most making processes require collaboration. This interaction between makers skilled in digital fabrication and practitioners knowledgeable in traditional techniques provides opportunities to build hybrid platforms. Inclusivity and diversity are also essential aspects of community building. A diverse community brings together different backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints, leading to more creative and inclusive solutions. As \u201cMake Community\u201d emphasizes, this diversity ensures that the makerspace can cater to a wide range of interests and needs, enriching the community culturally and allowing for the exchange of traditions, techniques, and ideas from different parts of the world . This cultural enrichment is a significant benefit, fostering mutual understanding and respect among community members. Development of the skills and hands-on learning are further enhanced through community engagement. According to the Fab Foundation, community interactions often result in various workshops, training and learning sessions. These activities help members develop new skills, improve existing ones, and stay updated with the latest technologies and methods. Mentorship from experienced members to apprentices fosters an environment of continuous learning and improvement for alternative presents and sustainable futures. Sustainability of the maker movement and makerspaces strengthened through community efforts. Members can share tools, materials, and resources, making the makerspace more sustainable and cost-effective. This collective approach reduces waste and promotes efficient use of resources. Additionally, a strong, engaged community can better withstand challenges and adapt to changes. Collaborative problem-solving and support networks help the makerspace navigate difficulties and continue to thrive. Innovation and creativity are significantly empowered by an engaged community. David Lang, in his TEDx Talk, highlights how engagement across different fields and disciplines can lead to innovative and interdisciplinary projects. Combining technology with traditional crafts can result in unique and groundbreaking creations. As mentioned above integration of digital fabrication tools to traditional practices support the diversity of communities in makerspaces. A diverse community fosters a creative and inspiring environment, encouraging members to experiment, try and fail, and think outside the box. In conclusion, community building and engagement are fundamental to the success and growth of makerspaces that are the hubs of alternative presents and sustainable futures. A diverse community enhances collaboration, innovation, and sustainability, making the makerspace an energetic and dynamic environment. By fostering inclusivity and actively engaging members, makerspaces can continue to evolve and make significant contributions to the maker movement and beyond.","title":"Master Project"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#master-project","text":"HANDBOOK FOR MAKERSPACES","title":"Master Project"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#introduction","text":"After spending a year in the MDEF01, delving into the community-based design approach and proposing alternative futures with the support of existing and future technologies, I have decided to continue my journey through MDEF02, focusing on maker movements. My aim is to explore new ways and methods to support creative personal spaces and community-based participative design processes by developing projects that combines digital fabrication tools and traditional craftsman techniques and projects in the makerspaces. This journey is also a guiding force for realizing my dream of establishing my own maker space, a dream I\u2019ve nurtured for 15 years. In a conversation with Tom\u00e1s D\u00edez-Master in Design for Emergent Futures(MDEF) program director-, he recommended careful consideration of various aspects, including location, an atlas of weak signals for those locations, available resources (people, space, stakeholders, financial support, potential collaborators, business model), and more. To initiate this endeavor, several fundamental steps must be defined to structure the idea of building and developing a maker space. These include questions such as: How to build a maker space? How to integrate digital fabrication tools into maker spaces? What projects can be developed to support makers/crafts, enhancing the idea of makerspaces and gaining recognition? How to combine a startup model with the idea of a maker space? Throughout this process, I plan to visit and participate in workshops on various topics in different makerspaces, and collaborate with makers from diverse backgrounds to understand multiple perspectives and needs of makers, participants, visitors, and staff. Through these interactions and collaborations, I aim to gain more experience and knowledge on the subject. By sharing our knowledge, we can create more opportunities for integrating digital fabrication tools into maker spaces and reinvigorating craftsmanship methods with the help of new technologies. In the era post-industrial revolution, the monopoly of manufacturers, restrictions in supply chains, and susceptibility to digital marketing attacks have dampened the productive and creative capacity of human beings. Fortunately, there is still a chance to hack the system and rediscover our abilities to produce, make, and grow our own goods locally, leveraging traditional knowledge and today\u2019s tools. Makerspaces serve as strong indicators, pioneers, and supporters of this movement. This research aims to provide guidance for individuals or groups interested in building their own or collective makerspaces. The primary focus of this research will be on urban productivity practices. In the realm of productivity and creativity, not only making but also growing represents a way to develop and rediscover our ability to add and create value in our environment. Therefore, urban farming will also be included in urban productivity practices during this research. Beyond the outcomes, making and growing involve multiple layers that guide makers toward their results. Throughout this research, I will attempt to define most of these steps, providing an alternative way of urban living in the era of post-industrial revolution, technology, and digitalization. First and foremost, this research will analyze the general structure of makerspaces, the ideology behind them, their management systems, and their marketing and development plans. Additionally, the research will explore and classify the makerspace movement according to industrially integrated, technologically integrated, and low-tech/craftsmanship models. Furthermore, I will draw on references such as thesis projects, books, articles, TEDx talks, and websites. Beyond those, I will also organize meetings, interviews, workshops, surveys with both maker space owners and participants that contribute those spaces. In line with the hands-on learning principles of MDEF program, this research will be an outcome of both theoretical information and creative hands-on practices. Throughout the literature review I will mention some names, books, websites and articles; \u201cNeil Gershenfeld\u201d- computer scientist and physicist, director of MIT\u2019s Center for Bits and Atoms,- and his book \u201cFab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop\u2014from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication\u201d. Neil Gershenfeld is widely recognized as the originator of Fab Labs(Fabrication Laboratories- tech base makerspaces). He introduced the idea of Fab Labs in the early 2000s as a way to provide communities with access to digital fabrication tools and technologies, enabling them to create and innovate at the local level. \u201cChris Anderson\u201d -an entrepreneur- and his book \u201cMakers: The New Industrial Revolution\u201d. Chris Anderson, a prominent figure in the maker movement, has significantly contributed to its popularization through his writings and activities. The book explores the impact of modern manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing and open-source hardware, on the economy and society. \u201cTom\u00e1s D\u00edez\u201d -an advocate of tech literacy at the grassroots level and co-founder of Fab Lab BCN- and his article \u201cPersonal Fabrication: Fab Labs as Platforms for Citizen-Based Innovation, from Microcontrollers to Cities\u201d. As an advocate of tech literacy and co-founder of Fab Lab BCN, Tom\u00e1s D\u00edez explores how digital fabrication tools empower communities, promote sustainable practices, and enable individuals to turn their ideas into tangible products. \u201cNurg\u00fcl Meri\u00e7liler\u201d -an architect and maker- and her thesis \u201cAn Interdisciplinary Perspective Towards MakerSpaces: 5 Cases from London\u201d. The structure of her work helped me to structure this project. \u201cDale Dougerthy\u201d -an entrepreneur and publisher- and his website \u201c www.makered.org \u201d. As the founder of MAKE magazine and the co-founder of Maker Faire, Dougherty has been instrumental in creating platforms that celebrate and showcase the creativity, innovation, and DIY (Do It Yourself) spirit of makers around the world. \u201cAdrian Smith\u201d and his article \u201cSocial Innovation, Democracy and Makerspaces\u201d. Adrian Smith\u2019s article delves into the social impact of the maker movement, providing valuable insights into its challenges from a broad perspective. \u201cWill Holman\u201d-an architect, write and maker- and his article \u201cMakerspace: Towards a New Civic Infrastructure\u201d. Will Holman\u2019s article explores how makerspaces can play a pivotal role in shaping the civic fabric of communities, emphasizing collaboration, hands-on learning, and the democratization of tools and technology. The article \u201cHuman Capabilities For Innovation In UK MakerSpaces\u201d by Cian O\u2019Donovan and Adrian Smith The article \u201cSoon You\u2019ll Be Able to Make Anything. It\u2019ll Change Politics Forever\u201d by Neil Gershenfeld, Alan Gershenfeld and Joel Cutcher-Gershenfeld The article \u201cThe New Production Ecosystem. Personal, distributed, open fabrication\u201d by Tom\u00e1s D\u00edez In the first chapter, I will conduct a literature review to elucidate concepts such as \u2018What is making?,\u2019 \u2018Who is a maker?,\u2019 \u2018What is a makerspace?,\u2019 \u2018Types of Makerspaces,\u2019 \u2018Maker Movement,\u2019 and \u2018The history and other processes that support the maker movement.\u2019 Subsequently, as a case study, I will analyze five makerspaces in Barcelona city, varying in scale and content, to illustrate the main structure of a makerspace and its impacts on society. This analysis will encompass different management approaches and community engagement plans. Finally, I will conclude the chapter by summarizing the outcomes of this case study and segue into the next chapter of the project. During the first chapter of this framework, my focus will be on the makerspaces in Barcelona. Currently residing in Barcelona, I find it advantageous to engage with them physically. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to attend events and workshops hosted by these makerspaces in their physical spaces. This first-hand experience has allowed me to observe their interactions with the community, understand their production processes, and witness their organizational methods. Barcelona stands out from other European cities as an ideal location for investigating makerspaces due to the widespread use of community-based networks, projects, and digital fabrication techniques. The city, being a center and model of urbanization in Europe, offers a unique cultural perspective. The second chapter will predominantly cover topics such as \u2018Working on the Context of a Makerspace,\u2019 \u2018Sustainability Plan,\u2019 \u2018Planning the Physical Space,\u2019 and \u2018Community Engagement Plan.\u2019 I will initiate contact with potential collaborators and stakeholders in the initial stages. Finally, for the last chapter, I will make search for European Funds, local funds, develop a business plan, and work on establishment strategies. To sum up, in the era of post industrial revolution, maker movements become more visible since 10-15 years. Open source concepts, digital fabrication tools, and participative design processes supports the makers in the urban spaces. Through this research I will examine the structures, management methods, community engagement plans, business models and establishment processes of several makerspaces. Consequently, there will be a handbook that would be used as a guidance for makers who would like to build their own makerspaces.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#chapter-1-literature-review-and-case-study","text":"","title":"Chapter 1: Literature Review and Case Study"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#11-what-is-making","text":"We are in an era where every gadget, especially electronics, often leads us to live more individualistically with the support of digital tools. This is why the phrase \u201cFood is the new internet\u201d has become popular in some circles, emphasizing the idea that activities like sharing food bring people together in physical spaces. In a similar vein, we could propose a new motto: \u201cMaking is the new clubbing.\u201d Making not only fosters creativity, productivity, and cooperation but also enhances social connections and a sense of community, reinforcing our ties to the neighborhood and cultivating a stronger sense of citizenship. Making is a multifaceted endeavor that goes beyond the mere act of creation. \u201cMaking is an activity that encourages people to use their minds more holistically for creating, using, and sharing\u201d (Canino-Fluit, 2014), on her article Canino suggests that making involves a comprehensive engagement of the mind, encompassing the creative process, utilization of created objects, and sharing of knowledge or creations with others. Canino emphasizes the holistic nature of the mental activities involved in the act of making. In line with Caninos approach, \u201cMaking is a process and a practice, not just an outcome.\u201d (Loes Bogers & Letizia Chiappini, 2019, p.9), according to Bogers and Chiappini making is presented as an ongoing process and a continuous practice, highlighting that the value of making extends beyond the final product. The emphasis is on the journey, learning, and skills development that occur during the making process. As a blend of these two, David Gauntlett \u201cMaking is connecting\u201d (2011) approaches to making as a form of connection, not just between physical materials but also between people. The act of making can bring individuals together, fostering connections and collaboration. It underscores the social aspect of making and its potential to build relationships. Making is a broad term that is used to refer the action of creating, producing, manufacturing an object, but mostly adding a value and meaning on an artefact. In his book \u201cMakers: The New Industrial Revolution,\u201d (2012) Anderson refers making as an act of creating physical objects using various tools, equipments, and manufacturing techniques. Making, in this way, goes beyond traditional craftsmanship with the support of modern technologies such as 3D printing, CNC machining, and other digital fabrication methods. Anderson describes making as a democratizing force that empowers individuals and communities to become and innovators, creators and entrepreneurs. Anderson describes making as a fundamental shift from traditional mass production to personalized, small-scale manufacturing. Additionally, Neil Gershenfeld, in his book \u201cFab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop-from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication,\u201d (2005) approaches to making as a fundamental human capability,and sees making as a transformative process that allows individuals to move beyond just being consumers of products to becoming participative producers. Gershenfeld believes that digital fabrication tools, such as 3D printers and laser cutters, can empower communities by providing access to technology and enabling individuals to turn their ideas into reality. On the other hand, it is essential to take a look on the definition of hacking when the subject is making. Hacking is has been used since 1960s. Whereas hacking involves the modification or repurposing of existing technology, making more centers around the creation of new artifacts from scratch. Both hacking and making promote open-source principles, encouraging collaboration and the sharing of ideas within a community of like-minded enthusiasts and contribute to the democratization of technology by breaking down traditional barriers and fostering a culture of innovation and resourcefulness. Even both activities need creativity, the slang term hacking used to sound a bit negative while making have more positive sense, making can be seen as a kind of hacking the system, industry, marketing, supply chain, monopoly in order to create alternative ways of living, producing, consuming, sharing. As Nurg\u00fcl Meri\u00e7liler summarizes that \u201cThe meanings of making and identifying as a maker are subjects of ongoing discussion, similar to the term hacking. While making is often linked to the utilization of digital tools, it also encompasses traditional creative practices like knitting, sewing, woodworking, and metalworking.\u201d (Meri\u00e7liler, 2023, p.29) To sum up, this framework approaches making as a process of producing knowledge than focusing on an artefact. Making encompasses a wide range of activities, including creating, producing, crafting, tinkering, building, and growing. It represents an intersection of art/craft and science, incorporating traditional techniques, technology, and design. It is a comprehensive term referring to the action of creating, producing, and manufacturing objects, with a primary focus on adding value and meaning to artifacts.","title":"1.1. What is Making?"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#12-who-is-a-maker","text":"\u201cWe are born Makers\u201d Chris Anderson \u201cWe are all Makers\u201d Dale Dougherty I certainly believe that we, as humans, possess amazing skills, particularly in survival, with instinctive abilities and an innate capacity to learn, discover, and improve. We have been transforming the world since the day we started crafting tools from stones and wood. However, personally, I disagree with the notion that we are all born makers. The influences of capitalism, industry, and marketing gurus have caused many individuals to overlook their creative potential. Numerous people are ensnared by ready-made meals provided by supermarket chains, and many struggle to prepare a simple dish to feed themselves. In his book \u201cMakers: The New Industrial Revolution,\u201d Chris Anderson describes makers as individuals who leverage modern manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing and open-source hardware, to innovate and create. In addition to tech-knowledge, entrepreneurship, and creativity are the other two essentials of Anderson\u2019s vision and definition of being a maker. Even though the cool term \u2018maker\u2019 commonly refers to a person with knowledge and skills in using digital tools like 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC machine cutting, and a 6-axis robot arm, this framework aims to define a maker from a broader perspective. In behalf of this exploration of the maker definition we have to analyze some more related terms as \u2018craft\u2019, \u2018hobbyist\u2019, \u2018do-it-yourselfer\u2019. Firstly, craft refers to the skilled practice of making things by hand. It often involves traditional techniques and artistic qualities and usually craft is a person who is an expert on a specific occupation with perfect skills in order to fulfill the tasks that necessary for the production processes. Secondly, a hobbyist is someone who engages in a particular hobby, which is a regular activity done for enjoyment during one\u2019s leisure time without financial gain focus. Thirdly, a DIYer is an individual who engages in the practice of doing tasks or creating things on their own, typically without professional assistance. DIYers mostly focus on home improvement projects, repairments, or creative endeavors. Self-sufficiency and personal accomplishment are the main take ons. Finally, a maker is someone who creates or constructs things, often using a combination of traditional and modern tools and technologies. The maker has a broader and more contemporary scope, incorporating a diverse range of skills and technologies, often with an emphasis on collaboration and sharing. Certainly, these terms\u2014hobbyist, craft, DIYer, and maker\u2014encompass a spectrum of creative pursuits, productivity and time commitment. A hobbyist engages in activities for personal pleasure during leisure, which may include crafts or DIY projects. Additionally, hobby is an activity that someone reproduce, copy, and repeat, while making is a way of being productive with more discipline and effort and needs more time commitment and collaborations. Craftsmanship involves skilled handiwork, emphasizing precision and artistic expression. DIYers take on tasks independently, often centered around home improvement or personal projects. In contrast, being a maker extends beyond these definitions. Makers embrace a diverse range of skills and technologies, incorporating traditional craftsmanship with modern tools like 3D printers and electronics. The maker ethos emphasizes collaboration and community, with makerspaces serving as hubs for shared resources and knowledge. While a hobbyist may indulge in crafting, and a DIYer seeks self-reliance, being a maker encompasses a broader and more contemporary approach, fostering a culture of creativity, innovation, and communal learning. In essence, being a maker can encompass elements of being a hobbyist, engaging in craftsmanship, and embracing a DIY ethos, but it goes beyond these terms by emphasizing a diverse set of skills, tools, and a collaborative community. Maker is a curious person who is eager to explore new fields and experience new techniques in order to transform the interacted environment by creative and productive processes and share all those in the community that he/she collaborates with.","title":"1.2. Who is a Maker?"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#13-what-is-a-makerspace","text":"In his book \u201cThe Great Good Place,(1989)\u201d Ray Oldenburg contends that third spaces play a crucial role in promoting civil society, democracy, civic engagement, and cultivating a strong sense of place. The third space can foster inclusivity, supporting a sense of belonging and connecting citizens to each other, communities, and cities through specific characteristics. These include being a neutral ground, where participants are not bound financially, politically, or legally and have no obligation to come and go; acting as a leveler, with socioeconomic status playing no role in acceptance; prioritizing conversation as the main activity in a playful atmosphere, avoiding tension; ensuring accessibility and accommodation; relying on regulars to set the mood and attract newcomers; maintaining a low profile with a horizontal hierarchy and cozy environment accepting of all individuals; and offering a home away from home, providing participants with a comfortable space similar to home. Even though Oldenburg\u2019s book doesn\u2019t directly discuss them, makerspaces, as contemporary examples of third space, embody the main principles of the third space concept, especially in the context of social interaction, community building, innovation, creativity, and accessibility. Basically, makerspaces are collaborative environments that provide tools and resources for individuals to create, innovate, and share ideas. In line with the concept of third space theory, David Gauntlett, in his book \u201cMaking is Connecting\u201d (2011), associates making and makerspaces with the idea that individuals feel more connected and engaged with the world when they actively contribute by creating things rather than just consuming. Gauntlett\u2019s perspective on making and makerspaces emphasizes active engagement, contribution, and a sense of connection, all of which resonate with the principles of third spaces, where individuals come together to participate, contribute, and build meaningful connections within communities. Therefore, makerspaces encompass both physical and social dimensions, providing participants with tools and knowledge while fostering connections with communities.\u201d Additionally, makerspaces are community-base productive places that provide workshop places with tools, equipments and knowledge on design, crafts, manufacturing techniques, technology, and various skills on fabrication to non-professionals in order to support innovation and entrepreneurship in society through co-making and co-producing in communities. Fablabs, hacker-spaces, product libraries/library of things, co-working and co-making spaces, community gardens, bio-construction sites, and decentralized creative hubs are examples of makerspaces. While these spaces may vary in ownership, membership structure, and specific focuses, they share a common commitment to providing \u2018tools and knowledge for people.\u2019 Furthermore, Adrian Smith approaches makerspaces from a sociological perspective, emphasizing their social innovation potential in his 2017 article \u201cSocial Innovation, Democracy, and Makerspaces.\u201d Smith delves into how makerspaces contribute to social innovation by fostering collaborative, community-driven solutions. He argues that these spaces empower citizens to actively engage in the innovation process, democratize technology, and address societal challenges. Smith\u2019s approach involves examining the social impact and democratic potential of makerspaces, revealing their role beyond technical innovation and into broader community development. However, Smith critically highlights issues such as consumerism, marketization, enclosure, intellectual property problems, social, gender, and demographic imbalances, and limited impact on structural change. Overall, Adrian Smith characterizes makerspaces as innovative spaces with a complex history, framed simultaneously as agents of social transformation, valuable educational tools, and promising environments for entrepreneurship. In summary, a makerspace is a collaborative and communal workspace that provides individuals -especially non-professionals-, often referred as makers, with the tools, knowledge, some resources, and place to create, experiment, and innovate. Makerspaces are equipped with various technologies, ranging from traditional tools to digital fabrication equipments like 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and robot arms. They serve as hubs for interdisciplinary collaboration, where individuals from diverse backgrounds, such as technology, design, and craftsmanship, can come together to work on projects, share knowledge, and learn new skills. Makerspaces embody the principles of hands-on learning and community engagement, fostering a culture of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship.","title":"1.3. What is a makerspace?"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#14-the-maker-movement","text":"The Maker Movement is a social and cultural phenomenon that emphasizes the creation of physical objects as a way to empower individuals, foster innovation, and encourage a hands-on, do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to learning. It is characterized by a community of individuals who share a passion for creating things and often involves the use of technology, open-source hardware, and collaborative spaces.The Maker Movement gained momentum in the early 2000s, inspired by the ethos of hacker and DIY cultures. Influences can be traced back to earlier movements like the Homebrew Computer Club in the 1970s and the early days of personal computing. The rise of the open-source software movement and the availability of information on the internet also played a crucial role in fostering the Maker Movement. Platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi became popular, providing accessible hardware for enthusiasts to experiment with. Additionally, manufacturing tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines, become affordable. By this way, individuals are able to turn their ideas into physical prototypes more easily. Finally, the new educational approach which is called hands-on, learning contributed to the popularity of making and maker movement in schools and universities. Maker Movement gets ahead community collaboration. Makers often share knowledge, resources, and projects through makerspaces, local and international events and online platforms. Makers and DIYers play a role in creating and modifying objects actively, and often using readily available tools and materials. In line with these they also embrace and support open source principles by sharing knowledge, design processes, results which encourage collaboration and the improvement of existing projects. Another characteristic of the maker movement is its interdisiplinary nature; Makers generally have diverse backgrounds, including technology, arts, crafts, engineering, design, which promotes exchange of ideas. In line with this approach, in his work Chris Anderson(2012) also explains the main features of the Maker Movement, centering predominantly on digital technologies intertwined with the movement\u2019s cultural ethos. Firstly, people uses digital desktop tools to craft designs for innovative products and subsequently create prototypes. Secondly, an established cultural practice to share the design and production processes and collaborate with others in online communities (supporting open source). And thirdly, using standardized design file formats enables individuals, at their creations, to submit their designs to commercial manufacturing services for production in any quantity. This significantly shortens the journey from conceptualization to production, mirroring the transformative impact the Web had on the dissemination of information and software. \u201cMake magazine, which I founded in 2005, harkens back to the magazines that hit their peak in the mid-20 th century, such as Popular Mechanics, which had the attitude, \u2018if it\u2019s fun, why not do it?\u2019. Such publications often helped people to start a hobby and learn new skills. Moreover, they helped the new hobbyist find a community of like-minded tinkerers to share ideas and experiences with. Maker Faire, which started in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2006, expanded this idea of learning and community and created a space where readers of the magazine could get together. At the faire, a maker could put an object they created up on a table and have people ask them about it. Having that kind of conversation with a range of people is the essence of the magazine, and of the whole movement.\u201d (Dale Dougherty, 2012, p.12) Maker Magazine and Maker Faire, founded by Dale Dougherty, have had a profound impact on the Maker Movement, contributing significantly to its growth, visibility, and community building. Launched in 2005, MAKE Magazine served as a crucial publication that showcased a wide array of DIY projects, hacks, and the maker culture. It became a central platform for sharing innovative ideas and practical tutorials, inspiring individuals to embrace hands-on creativity. Maker Faire, initiated in 2006, further propelled the movement by organizing large-scale events where makers from diverse backgrounds could exhibit their creations. These events not only brought the maker culture into the mainstream but also provided a physical space for enthusiasts to connect, collaborate, and share their passion for making. Maker Faire, with its vibrant and diverse showcases, played a pivotal role in fostering a sense of community and encouraging the collaborative spirit that defines the Maker Movement today. Together, Maker Magazine and Maker Faire have played instrumental roles in popularizing the maker ethos, inspiring creativity, and establishing a global community of makers. While Maker Faire and Maker Magazine played a crucial role in popularizing and catalyzing the Maker Movement, it\u2019s essential to note that the movement itself had early roots and influences before the inception of both. Certainly, there are some other factors, events, movements, developments that we need to consider in order to understand the maker movement better. I will provide a brief overview of the evolution of making, highlighting key movements and insights spanning from the 19 th to the 21 st century. The Great Exhibition (1851) & Arts and Crafts Movement (Late 19 th to Early 20 th Century); Within the social environment of England during the early stages of industrial revolution The Great Exhibition event gave an opportunity to show to the public how everyday objects/tools were manufactured. This raised an awareness about the production and manufacturing techniques, the backstages of the shops and stories of everyday objects. The exhibition\u2019s emphasis on industrial progress sparked a reaction against mass-produced, standardized goods. Individuals began to value craftsmanship and unique, handmade items, setting the stage for a shift towards a more individualistic and artisanal approach which were the first inspirations of the DIY culture. In line with \u201cThe Great Exhibition\u201d event, the arts and crafts movement, that was a reaction to the negative impacts of industrialisations and the comparatively low standing of the decorative arts, celebrated handmade goods and the skilled artisans who created them, emphasizing the connection between the creator and the crafted object. In summary, \u201cThe Great Exhibition\u201d and the Arts and Crafts Movement influenced the Maker Movement by inspiring a return to craftsmanship, individual creativity, and a rejection of mass production.While the direct link between The Great Exhibition and the Maker Movement may not be overt, the exhibition\u2019s impact on industrialization, technological innovation, and changing attitudes toward craftsmanship set the stage for a renewed appreciation for hands-on creativity and a return to individualized, artisanal approaches to making. The Maker Movement, with its emphasis on DIY culture, innovation, and craftsmanship, reflects a contemporary echo of the questions and values raised during the time of The Great Exhibition. Bauhaus school and Movement (1919-1933); Bauhaus was a design school that started to operate in 1919 in Germany and continued till 1933. (based in Weimar until 1925, Dessau through 1932, and Berlin in its final months) Beyond being a design school, Bauhaus is a movement and a strong, long-lasting design principle. This is the case that occurred by the very well organized, executed and developed educational curriculum and structure which combined arts and crafts with technology. Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus, aimed to built an inclusive community for artists and crafts people through the education methodology in the Bauhaus School. In order to achieve this, the educational programs focused on collaborations of teachers and students with the public and industry. This cooperation philosophy helped to school to become a trend that was influenced by not only arts and crafts but also modernism and constructivism and a long-lasting design principle. Later on, these cooperations expanded to the industrialisation by working on mass production. Workshop practices of the Bauhaus school became the core of the educational structure and encouraged the students to craftsmanship a lot and were transformed into manufacturies that were another kind of executing and connecting with the public. This transformation can be taken as a model of todays makerspaces and the makerspace movements. Walter Gropius (1883 \u20131969) was a German - American architect and founder of the Bauhaus School. Gropius managed the Bauhaus as its director until 1928. Do-It-Yourself Movement (1960s); Do-it-Yourself(DIY) is making, building, repairing or modifying things/projects without any support from an expert or a professional. The DIY as a term and ideology appeared with the home improvement and maintenance activities during 1910s, but became more popular and turned into a movement in 1960s. The DIY projects are designed to be realized at home or small workshops. DIY projects also need the knowledge of using practical hand-tools and machines. Even anti-consumerism was one of the main aim of the DIY movement, practical hand-tools and machines manufactures marketed DIY projects and supported the ideology a lot. While the DIY movement more focused on individualism, with the makerspace movement it turned into Do-it-with-others(DIWO) by collaborative projects in the makerspace workshops.(Hartmann & Mietznel, 2017) The DIY (Do-It-Yourself) culture of the 1960s serves as a crucial precursor to the contemporary Maker Movement, influencing its ethos and values. Rooted in countercultural movements and emphasizing self-sufficiency, the 1960s DIY culture initially focused on hands-on practices and a rejection of mainstream consumerism. As technology became more accessible, the DIY movement evolved to incorporate electronics and emerging technologies, with enthusiasts engaging in hacking and modifications. The open-source and collaborative spirit inherent in the 1960s DIY culture became a cornerstone of the Maker Movement, where makers openly share knowledge, designs, and project details. The DIY culture\u2019s emphasis on empowerment, individual creativity, and a shift from consumerism to active creation resonates strongly in the Maker Movement, which builds upon these principles while expanding its scope to include advanced technologies and collaborative community spaces. In essence, the DIY culture laid the foundation for the Maker Movement, shaping its approach to technology, innovation, and the celebration of hands-on creativity. Both share a fundamental belief in the power of individuals to shape and create their own technological and creative destinies. Hackerspace movement and open-source concept; Hackerspaces, also known as makerspaces or fab labs, are community-centric spaces where individuals gather to share tools, knowledge, and resources. These physical spaces provide a collaborative environment for makers to work on projects. Hackerspaces provide access to diverse tools, from traditional hand tools to digital fabrication equipment as 3D printers and CNC machines. This accessibility lowers barriers to entry and offers makers to experiment with technologies they do not have at home. Furthermore, the community-base nature of hackerspaces encourage collaboration and sharing. By peer to peer learning, makers can learn from each other, collaborate on projects, and access a diverse range of expertise within the community. Thus, experimental and free environment of hackerspaces foster innovation and iteration. Makers can explore new ideas, overcome challenges, and develope projects with the community support. In agreement with hackerspace movement, open-source concepts, rooted in transparency and collaboration, have significantly influenced the Maker Movement. The concept of open source promotes the sharing of knowledge and project documentation. Makers freely share their designs, code, and detailed instructions, contributing to a collective pool of resources and facilitating learning within the community. Additionally, the concept democratizes technology by making it more accessible and its iterative nature aligns with the iterative approach of makers. Projects are continually improved upon, and the collaborative feedback loop encourages innovation and refinement. Both the Hackerspace movement and open-source concepts boost the collaborative and community-based characteristics of the Maker Movement. Makerspaces provide physical spaces for collaboration, whereas open source promotes the sharing of recources and knowledge. Democratization of technology is the consequence of the combination of both movements that makers with diverse backgrounds can access tools, learn new skills, and play significant role in technological innovation. In essence, the hackerspace movement and open-source concepts also contributed the collaborative, accessible, and innovative culture of the Maker Movement. Critics on makerspaces and maker movement? Critics of makerspaces and the Maker Movement have focused on various topics, highlighting both the potential difficulties and the societal implications of these creative environments. While Daryl Koehn offers criticism regarding the Maker Movement\u2019s lack of diversity, its origins, and its future trajectory, highlighting concerns about the maker culture\u2019s failure to adopt an inclusive stance for all individuals in his article \u201cThe Ethics of the Maker Movement: The Potentially Good and the Possibly Terrible\u201d(2015), Minka Stoyanova (2017) mainly highlighted the demographic, social and gender imbalances in the makerspaces. On the other hand, Adrian Smith, in his 2017 article \u201cSocial Innovation, Democracy, and Makerspaces\u201d, highlights the varied concerns raised by critics of makerspaces regarding these creative environments. The focus is on institutional developments and the potential drawbacks associated with their increasing popularity. One major critique revolves around makerspaces\u2019 tendency to fixate on object production and oversimplify complex social challenges through prototyping, emphasizing the necessity for a more nuanced approach to broader social transformation. Another area of concern is the commercialization of the maker movement, where initiatives like Make magazine and Maker Faires are perceived as showcases for consumer tools, materials, and kits, supporting a new form of consumerism. Criticisms also extend to makerspace organizations receiving sponsorship from corporations and government agencies with questionable social responsibility records, raising questions about co-option and the compromise of grassroots autonomy. Moreover, concerns are raised about new forms of exploitation in maker-related design and fabrication platforms, potentially encroaching on open design principles. In response, there is a growing interest in cooperative models and public funding for more open-ended makerspaces, but persistent social imbalances and demographic disparities highlight ongoing challenges in achieving inclusivity and transformative social innovations within these creative spaces. Despite these criticisms, there are ongoing efforts within the maker community to address these concerns, including exploring cooperative models, promoting inclusivity, and advocating for public funding that aligns with social goods and sustainable development goals. The debates surrounding makerspaces and the Maker Movement highlight the complex interplay between creativity, technology, and societal impacts. So far, makerspaces have made significant progress, evolving from their earlier stages as \u2018tools for everyone\u2019 to becoming hubs for technology literacy, accessible digital fabrication, and meaningful social production. Moving forward, in order to ensure the sustainability of both new and existing makerspaces in the era of technology and artificial intelligence, there should be some development plans. Without such a plan, like 95% of startups and small businesses, they might share the same destiny of being erased from the system.","title":"1.4.

While makerspaces are commonly associated with digital fabrication, emergent technologies, and technological literacy, this case study also encompasses urban farming and spaces dedicated to cultivation in the urban. As various makerspaces have started to work on projects related to sustainable food production and agriculture this makes sense for the case study. These final informations were gathered through a series of interviews, with outcomes predominantly derived from active participation in events, workshops, multiple visits, volunteering, and studying within these makerspaces and projects. During the literature review and advisory sessions with Santi Fuentemilla, the Future Learning Lead at Fab Lab BCN, we explored the identity cards of machines in Fab Lab BCN. This exploration inspired me to extend the concept to the creation of identity cards for various makerspaces. In my search for a suitable method to design these identity cards, I attended a makers gathering known as the \u2018Network of Productive & Collaborative Spaces in Barcelona\u2019 at MakerConvent. This experience highlighted the significance of documentation for improvement and how digital tools can support this process. Although the meeting was conducted in Catalan and primarily involved physical tools and materials, I didn\u2019t leave with tangible resources except for a few photos. Consequently, I decided to create a miro board to develop identity cards for each makerspace that I intended to focus on. At this stage, I contemplated options to involve my guests in the creation process of identity cards during interviews. The first lecture of MDEF, titled \u2018Atlas of Weak Signals,\u2019 aimed at helping participants build and enhance their personal design space throughout the MDEF journey. This lecture served as inspiration, prompting me to initiate the development of a set of cards named \u2018Atlas of Makerspaces.\u2019 These cards were intended to facilitate the construction of identity cards for each makerspace, making the interview process more engaging and meaningful compared to a basic question-and-answer session. To establish a structured approach for conducting interviews, I recognized the need for a mapping system. After analyzing the components of makerspaces, I designed a connection and relation map applicable to every makerspace. This mapping divided makerspace components into three main groups: domain, physical space, and community, each with its own sub-categories. The \u2018domain\u2019 category, for instance, included subcategories such as impact, motivation, ideology, activities, sustainability model, challenges, scale, hierarchy, accessibility, and network. The \u2018physical space\u2019 category encompassed components like machines, tools and equipment, techniques, and materials. Lastly, the \u2018community\u2019 category comprised collaborators, participants, executers, supporters, and guests. Furthermore, I expanded the set of cards to support each category based on my experiences and observations during my visits, participations, volunteerings to various makerspaces. As part of the collaborative process, during MDEF01, I encouraged collaborators to create additional cards if deemed necessary. This iterative approach allowed the card set to evolve and improve with increased use. While I have conducted only five interviews thus far, continued usage is expected to contribute to further enhancements. \u201cThe necessity of keywords and visualization to attack the attention, reach more people and get more feedbacks\u201d While the power of words, sentences, and paragraphs is undeniable, we find ourselves in an era where time is a precious commodity, especially when contemplating complex subjects. ChatGPT widely used for summarizing every single article. The primary concept behind analyzing makerspaces through identity cards is to craft a visual representation with easily digestible keywords that capture attention at a glance. Undoubtedly, further detailed work is required to enhance the design. Nonetheless, the current approach adequately lays the groundwork for structuring the idea and mapping the connections and relations among makerspaces. Through this case study, I selected five makerspaces with various scale, content, ideology, sustainability model, accesiblity, and community engagement plan. There makerspaces are; AKASHA Hub: A creative hub with decentralized, and self-managed community MakerConvent: A makerspace focuses on tech literacy among young individuals and retirees Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines : A library of things and platform that connects self-employed professionals and locals Fab Lab BCn: A research and education center focuses on digital fabrication Bioma/ConnectHort: A local community garden and center of bio-construction research.","title":"1.5.1 Atlas of Makerspaces/Mapping Methodology/Makerspace ID Cards"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#152-akasha-hub","text":"\u201dWe are a community that believes in continuous improvement, transparency, collaboration, and our independence as a symbol of resilience, intellectual freedom and action.

Social innovation is the fundamental motivation and impact since its establishment. As Carmen Tanaka mentioned during the interview \u201cAKASHA Hub is a non-profit association and they are trying to build a diverse, decentralized, and self-managed community which is interdisciplinary, independent within the self-financed structure. They are working to offer innovative solutions to citizens and to the neighborhood so that they have resources and models to build, improve or create together a sustainable society.\u201d The horizontal hierarchy of the structure and different membership options promote the accessibility of the project. Consequently, the project can empower the social innovation supported by creativity, productivity, collaboration, environmental sustainability, and technology literacy. Additionally, the diversity of AKASHA Hub members, their professions, backgrounds and experience, makes each contribution of knowledge unique, valuable and differential, which leads to create actions-projects with a local focus and with global impact. Akasha-Hub is a new model for a productive and creative co-working community. It provides an alternative creative space with its 2 warehouses, to 38 residents and 600+ members. AKASHA Hub looking for collaborations in social causes, creating innovative projects focused on a sustainable, green and conscious city-society since 2017. In order to achieve this goal, they generated, designed, hosted, and organized a variety of projects and events to showcase their contributions to their community, neighborhood, and the city of Barcelona. Off Topic Films, Urban Planting Project, Geo-Llum, Hub Networks, and Green City Lab are some of the major projects that Akasha-Hub distributed. So far, Akasha did not get any European Union funds or support from the central or local governments. But, Green City Lab is a special project that Akasha community designed and developed and got the support from public (Cuerpo Europeo de Solidaridad and Ajuntament de Barcelona) fro the first time. Green City Lab is a big scale project which provides residency to some participants, provides space, knowledge, and opportunities for refugees.In short, the primary objective of the project is to build the New Model of the Urban Garden of El Clot. However, it also serves as a perfect showcase for the diverse approaches of AKASHA Hub in terms of project variety, structure, and community engagement. While one of the warehouse mostly used as a co-working space which is quite hybrid, also used for experiments, events and getherings, the second warehouse provides a space with traditional hand tools, machines and with limited digital fabrication tools to the makers and manufacturers who wants to build and produce some goods. Akasha has a solid plan to buy a CNC machine to support the manufacturing activities more in the near future. Furthermore, they are also trying a new model of management structure which is called Smart-Trust to make things more accessible and processes easier. Carmen described this way as a new model of community engagement and to let the members more participative and responsive in the Hub. Smart-trust is a part of self-management that AKASHA Hub uses to maintain the decentralized projects that distributed. In sum, AKASHA Hub is a decentralized project and a self-managed community, with its main node in Barcelona. A community with diverse professional profiles that connect people, projects and agents to generate sustainable ideas, find possibilities for innovation and develop new models of local society and applicable gloablly.

This wave of interest puts the focus on makerspaces and spaces related to digital manufacturing. Schools, cities, universities, libraries\u2026 this new model of spaces suddenly appears everywhere\u201d MakerConvent is a makerspace founded by Oscar Mart\u00ednez Ciur\u00f3 in 2011. Oscar, who holds various titles and has diverse interests, can be broadly described as a cultural educator. In one of our conversations, he expressed a consistent interest in alternative education methods, particularly for young individuals. After encountering 3D printers several years ago, he foresaw the future of manufacturing and production. This led him to concentrate on digital fabrication techniques, making the establishment of a makerspace an unavoidable project at that time. Oscar referred to MakerConvent as a creative hub and education center with a significant influence on tech literacy and local social interactions. In order to do so, Oscar invested a lot of time, energy to this project. His primary emphasis is on inspiring young individuals to engage with maker culture, particularly those who may lack motivation for conventional and traditional educational approaches. MakerConvent has, to date, distributed long term education projects for youths related to making that also include digital fabrication. Oscar set MakerConvent within the direction of the \u201cCentre Civic Convent Sant Agusti\u201d. He took the advantage of EU fundings through the municipality for the establishment but donations were accepted as well especially for the tools, equipments and machines. MakerConvent is a project inspired by FabLabs but socially more open for local communities. Moreover, MakerConvent positions itself within \u201cCritical Making\u201d that combines creation with critical reflection on technology in everyday life. In Critical Making, the act of creating is considered a form of critical reflection, a pedagogical practice that evokes and provokes socially critical attitudes through creation. There is a horizontal hierarchy at MakerConvent, where peer-to-peer knowledge serves as the primary learning method. The community emphasizes learning by doing, sharing, giving, enjoying, exchanging, and participating. The space is inclusive and welcomes participants across a wide demographic range. MakerConvent not only focuses on young individuals but also strives to enhance tech literacy among retirees. Moreover, they conduct workshops on traditional production techniques such as sewing, carpentry, and screen printing. Despite not being very large, the space is well-organized and accommodates various activities simultaneously. Oscar mentioned that the size of the space imposes limitations on participation. Additionally, dealing with bureaucracy from local authorities, maintaining and nurturing the community surrounding the makerspace, staying updated, and being able to address the community\u2019s needs are the primary challenges faced by MakerConvent. \u201cDo. just do This is the key.\u201d At MakerConvent making is central to what it means to be human. There is a unique feeling about doing physical things. But, first of all, we have to learn how to do. Always try to learn more about what we build. Then, we need to have access to the right tools to be able to do and maker tools have never been cheaper, easier to use, or more powerful as today. Also, we have to be playful with what is being done, and we will be surprised, excited and proud of what we discover. Additionally, sharing is highly recommended what we have done and what we know how to do with others is the method by which the feeling of a maker is achieved in its entirety. So, this is a movement, and it requires emotional, intellectual, economic, political and institutional support. The best hope for improving the world comes from doing, and we are responsible for making a better future in MakerConvent. In order to achieve so, through several collaboration with other makerspaces in Barcelona and also various EU projects MakerConvent looks for the link between creation and empowerment, critical attitude and citizenship.

Daniel Pardo, an ecological activist, coordinator, learner, one of the co-founder of the project, successfully manages the space. Despite the size of the space limiting participation in each event held for the project, as Daniel mentioned during our meetings, their persistent decision on the location of the space, which is in the old quarter and has direct access from the street, supports both visibility and accessibility of the makerspace in the neighborhood. The initial concept of establishing a product library to improve the local people\u2019s lives by sharing tools, equipment, and machines emerged in 2014. However, the process of drafting a project proposal to secure EU funds through the municipality took some time. In 2019, they made a second attempt and successfully obtained support from the municipality. Then, as Daniel mentioned, \u2018the pandemic happened all of a sudden.\u2019 Despite the unexpected challenge, they persevered. They managed to find a location with direct street access, enhancing the organization\u2019s visibility and accessibility, as mentioned earlier. They seized the opportunity to situate themselves in the heart of the old town in Barcelona. Ecological activism is one of the main motivation for this project. That\u2019s why in CdEF, they are trying to build a community around the idea of \u201crepair, reuse, and share\u201d against consumerism. In order to do so, first of all they are providing several tools, equipments, and machines. Locals can borrow them by visiting the space physically. All the tools and informations on their availabilities can be checked through their website www.einesifeines.org . Membership is needed to borrow any item and a symbolic fee is necessary for registration. They are funded by municipality and accepting donations of things for product library. In parallel, the registration fees are taken as donations and there is not a fixed price for that. Thus, to support the idea \u201cSharing resources extends their useful life and reduces waste production\u201d they are managing a basic system that is completely inclusive and accessible. \u201cWhy do we need large agencies when there is someone in the neighborhood who can do it?\u201d Additionally, at CdEF, they actively organize workshops to foster a sense of community around the makerspace. These workshops serve as a platform connecting individuals seeking services with independent professionals and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that offer them. The primary motivations for participation include reforming, repairing, sharing knowledge, seeking advice, and fostering collaboration. Notably, the organization operates without a hierarchical structure, making it easy for researchers like us in MDEF/IAAC to gain a first person perspective and engage in design within the communities. Unlike tool borrowing, workshop participation does not require membership, promoting inclusivity. Workshop announcements are disseminated through both their website and physical posters placed around the neighborhood, ensuring outreach to diverse communities. Beside the workshops, at CdEF they offer a platform to contact the self-employed professionals and SMEs with the locals. With this service, they facilitate the neighborhood\u2019s access to quality services, promote the local and small-scale economy and strengthen community ties in the neighborhood. As CdEF is a small-scale makerspace that is still growing, they may not currently have access to a comprehensive range of tools. However, the absence of digital fabrication tools does not hinder them from organizing and offering workshops related to tech subjects such as coding and robotics. Collaborators can source the required tech-tools from other makerspaces. Furthermore, Caixa directly collaborates with MakerConvent for various projects, including a Robotics workshop organized by researchers for young individuals. On the other hand, as Daniel shared, they have faced challenges since the beginning, including gaining recognition, financial aspects, and dealing with bureaucracy. Nevertheless, they are experiencing growth, currently having 10-15 collaborators and acquiring over 300 members within three years. Due to space limitations, Daniel mentioned that they primarily advertise workshops within the neighborhood but are open to participation from anywhere. In an ideal scenario, Daniel envisions a product library for each neighborhood becoming a mainstream movement supported by local governments. They are open to collaborations to realize this goal, aiming to raise awareness of ecological sustainability and foster connections between self-employed professionals and SMEs with the local community on a citywide scale.

Gershenfeld emphasizes the idea that everyone is inherently a maker, capable of creating and fabricating things. The concept of Fab Labs, which Gershenfeld pioneered, involves creating community spaces equipped with digital fabrication tools, where people can come together to learn, collaborate, and bring their creative projects to life. Fab Lab Barcelona is a research and education centre that mostly focuses on digital fabrication and technology which will shape our way of living, working, and discovering in cities. Fab Lab organizations are among the most important pioneers of the maker movement. Fab Lab BCN, founded in 2007, holds the distinction of being the first Fab Lab established in the European Union. It was a cosmic encounter moment that Tomas Diez, Shane Salisbury, and Victor Vina met with Neil Gershenfeld -a professor at MIT/computer scientists and physicist- and with the housing and technologic support of the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) they founded the Fab Lab BCN. Fab Labs are large-scale maker organizations executed by tech experts connected to a powerful network of over 1800 Fab Labs in over 100 countries. At Fab Lab BCN, experts engage in research projects such as Smart Citizen, DIY 3D Printers, Making Sense, MakeIt, Grow, Centrino, FoodShift. On the other hand, in collaboration with partners, they provide educational programs such as the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF). The lab also incubates projects like Fab Academy, Green Fab Lab, Fab City, and Fab Textiles. The primary motivation and impact of these projects are innovation through tech literacy, support for local communities and the economy, and the use of technological infrastructures to enhance daily life standards in urban areas. Additionally, their educational programs incorporate design methodologies that include public and social participation. As an alumnus of IAAC and Fab Lab BCN, I had the opportunity to experience and witness many processes. Additionally, I conducted an interview with Guillem Camprodo -Executive Director- to gather his insights and share details about the experience. Guillem mentioned that, although it was a significant advantage that IAAC shared space and digital fabrication tools with Fab Lab BCN for the establishment, it posed a challenge to gain recognition and establish a sustainability plan for Fab Lab BCN independent of IAAC. Until that time, the research and development processes/activities were primarily distributed and financed by global companies and well-known universities. This was not the conventional approach, especially in Europe, for working on innovative possibilities among independent labs. In order to gain recognition, they organized many events included the young individuals and developed projects to attended well-known events as Hyperhabitat at Venice Biennale. Additionally, they organized the first Exhibition about 3D Printing in Barcelona, and they run a Fab Lab at the Design Museum. Furthermore, maintaining a reasonable level of hierarchy to provide personal space and freedom for innovation became another challenge as the staff grew. Guillem also emphasized that this challenge is not unique to Fab Lab BCN but is shared by all makerspaces. While makerspaces have grown by providing digital fabrication tools and knowledge for individual and communal production, the focus now shifts to developing sustainable plans for the future. The question arises: What will be the development and sustainability plan for each makerspace to continue existing as a valuable contribution to the communities?\u201d Then, he quickly suggested that there should be some transitions and new coalitions to build new structures for communities in order to share knowledge, spaces, tools and support innovation. \u201cOur mission at Fab Lab Barcelona is to provide access to the tools, knowledge and means to educate, innovate and invent using technology and digital fabrication to allow anyone to make (almost) anything.\u201d Based on my experiences, Fab Lab BCN provides access to a wide array of tools, enabling participants to create almost anything. Digital fabrication tools, including a robotic arm, are readily accessible. While there isn\u2019t an injection molding opportunity, makers can engage in discussions about alternative production/manufacturing methods to bring their plans to life. The space offers traditional production techniques, often combined with digital fabrication tools. The staff comprises experts who willingly share their knowledge when needed. The fostering of a collective mindset, sharing, constructive feedback, and open communication are highly valued to improve making skills. Unlike some Fab Labs that have open days for local makers to access the space and facilities, Fab Lab BCN is an exclusive maker space. Training programs come at a cost. At first glance, this might seem contradictory to the ethos of the maker movement, but several considerations, such as security, organization, and regulations, must be taken into account when hosting guests in a large-scale organization like Fab Lab BCN. On the other hand, Fab Lab BCN is open to other local communities and makerspaces working in innovative fields. They host numerous events and collaborations, both locally and internationally. However, sharing the space and tools with IAAC is another factor limiting public access. \u201cLocally productive, globally-connected cities, Barcelona became the first city to sign up to the challenge to produce everything the city consumes by 2054. Fab Lab Barcelona, alongside IAAC and Barcelona City Council are collaborating locally to implement new models through interventions in governance and policy.\u201d In summary, Fab Lab BCN is a large-scale maker space organization that serves as a driving force within the global maker movement. Functioning as both a research and education center, it designs, conducts, and supports various projects. This goes beyond merely providing digital manufacturing technologies and tools for prototyping; it involves hosting events, supporting collaborations, and fostering alternative maker and grower communities, both locally and globally. All of these efforts align with the overarching goal of working towards environmentally sustainable futures and locally productive communities.

The project provides training and support for urban farmers and promotes the consumption of locally grown organic produce. It\u2019s part of Barcelona\u2019s broader efforts to promote urban sustainability and resilience through initiatives such as urban agriculture and local food production. They also host some communities that work on bio-construction and related materials workshops to contribute other communities. The phrase \u201cFood is the new internet\u201d suggests a comparison between the transformative impact of the internet on various aspects of life and the potential for a similar transformation in the food industry. It implies that innovations, technologies, and changes in the way we produce, distribute, and consume food could have a revolutionary impact, similar to how the internet has transformed communication, information access, and various industries. The concept often relates to advancements in areas like sustainable agriculture, food tech, and alternative food sources, emphasizing the potential for positive change and disruption in the food sector. Consequently, I had decided to include Bioma(An urban community garden and bio-construction project) as a part of makerspace movement. Community gardens are, in my opinion, essential in urban spaces to maintain a connection with the soil and agriculture, especially for younger generations. In many metropolitan cities, younger people believe that food is automatically produced by chain supermarkets\u2019 shelves, leading to a lack of awareness about production processes and resulting in significant food waste. The Bioma project began in 2013 under the name ConnectHort. The community organization decided to transform the land, previously occupied by a building in Barcelona\u2019s old industrial area, into a community garden. The land is owned by the municipality, and the Bioma community occasionally needs to renew their contract for its use. Because the project relies on volunteering, there are sometimes delays in decision-making. Additionally, like most other small community gardens in Barcelona, the space is not open to the public 24/7. This limitation is a significant disadvantage for community garden projects, preventing them from becoming mainstream. Vandalism is cited as the reason for not keeping the community garden spaces open and accessible to the public around the clock. I attended the ConnectHort community garden several times as a volunteer, helping to organize the space during the spring. From community members, I learned skills and knowledge about growing vegetables and planting trees. I also met new people who came to volunteer like myself. While there isn\u2019t a strict hierarchy, orientation is necessary as volunteering is the main structure. Additionally, I contacted Sebastian Barreto, who manages the Bioma Project community, and gathered more information about their future plans. Permaculture and sustainable agriculture are the main activities in the garden, attracting a large international community. They maintain connections with other urban gardens, makerspaces, and academic institutions like IAAC, which supports the international community. Furthermore, with the help of neighbors, they produce a significant amount of compost necessary for the space and its agricultural activities. They hosted the Comida (Vertical Garden) project led by IAAC and are currently working on ongoing projects, including making cobs (sun-dried bricks) from mud and straw by guest communities, as well as organizing bio-plastic workshops. Moreover, they are exploring possible solutions to make the urban garden more open and accessible to diverse communities. The primary challenge of urban gardens in big cities is vandalism. Since urban gardens mostly rely on volunteering, ensuring safety in crowded cities can be difficult. Even in most metropolitan cities, municipalities prefer to close central parks at night for security reasons. However, this security measure reduces the accessibility of urban gardens and diminishes community diversity. It\u2019s common for urban green space initiatives to face various challenges related to land use, zoning regulations, funding, and community engagement. As Sebastian mentioned, dealing with bureaucratic processes within the Barcelona municipality, such as obtaining permits, licenses, or approvals, can be time-consuming and complex. Moreover, maintaining open and well-maintained spaces requires ongoing effort and resources. Ensuring that the space remains sustainable and accessible to the community over the long term can be another challenge. To sum up, Bioma project in Barcelona is a fascinating initiative aimed at creating a sustainable and biodiverse urban environment. It involves the development of green spaces and ecological corridors within the city to promote biodiversity, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life for residents. The project encompasses various elements such as green roofs, vertical gardens, urban parks, and tree planting initiatives, all designed to integrate nature into the urban fabric and mitigate the effects of urbanization on the environment.

This development journey, often referred to as the \u201ctransition of makerspaces,\u201d has been a dynamic and transformative process. Initially, makerspaces were simple workshops focused on digital fabrication, but they have evolved into vibrant social innovation and creative hubs deeply integrated into neighborhoods. The early makerspaces, often inspired by the Fab Lab model developed at MIT, primarily served as workshops equipped with digital fabrication tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines. These spaces aimed to provide individuals with access to advanced manufacturing technologies that were typically inaccessible to the general public at the time. But, even in the early stages, education and community-building were the key components. Fab Labs based makerspaces offered workshops and training sessions to teach members how to use the equipment and develop their technical skills. This is the key component that give the chance of evolving to a movement like the Bauhaus movement as mentioned in the previous chapters. As the maker movement grew, makerspaces began to diversify their activities beyond digital fabrication. They started to include more traditional tools and crafts, integrating activities like woodworking, metalworking, electronics, and textiles. Consequently, makerspaces increasingly became venues for collaborative projects, where individuals with different skills could come together to work on shared goals. This collaborative spirit led to the creation of innovative products and solutions, often with a focus on sustainability and community benefit. Motivated by expansion and diversification, makerspaces went beyond being just workshops for digital fabrication. Makerspaces began addressing broader social issues, such as sustainability, education, and local economic development. They became platforms for social innovation, where communities could come together to tackle local challenges. This vision shift allowed makerspaces to engage more directly with local communities. They hosted events, workshops, and programs tailored to the specific needs and interests of their communities, neighborhoods and cities, fostering a sense of ownership and participation. Consequently, makerspaces evolved into cultural and creative hubs, offering not only technical and fabrication skills but also arts, crafts, and design. They became places where creativity could flourish in various forms, supporting artistic endeavors and cultural activities. Furthermore, it is essential to mention the circular economy approach to understand the transition of makerspaces from digital fabrication workshops to social innovation and creative hubs. This evolution has been driven by the needs and opportunities within communities and urban areas, especially in big cities. Climate change, growing population, and modern consumption culture have raised the need for sustainability. As a solution and key factor in achieving a sustainable future, the concept of circular and regenerative cities was born. Many makerspaces, particularly those aiming to remain relevant and pioneer change, decided to adopt circular principles. With support from the European Union, numerous projects have been developed to realize the concept of circular and regenerative cities. In the second chapter of this framework, we will examine the transition process of makerspaces as they evolved from basic workshops focused on digital fabrication to social innovation and creative hubs fully integrated into their neighborhoods and local communities. To understand this evolution, it is necessary to explore several concepts and related projects that makerspaces have engaged in and created in response. Key components include the circular economy, waste management, redesigning artisanal practices with digital fabrication tools, the power of prototyping for development and social innovation, and community engagement, as well as building new coalitions between makers and professionals. These elements are crucial for understanding the development process of makerspaces and ensuring that the maker movement continues to evolve and remain grassroots","title":"2.1 From Basic Workshops for Digital Fab to Social Innovation and Creative Hubs"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#22-how-makerspaces-benefit-and-support-the-circular-economy","text":"Throughout the development process of makerspaces, new ideas and concepts have empowered the evolution of the maker movement. To further understand this process and build upon the existing success of the maker movement, the circular economy must be taken into consideration. The circular economy is an operating model where we reduce the amount of natural resources needed and minimize waste by keeping materials in use for as long as possible. This contrasts sharply with the current linear economy, where we extract resources, manufacture items, use them, and then dispose of them in landfills. The world faces a significant waste problem, with 300 million tons of plastic disposed of each year, equivalent to the weight of the human population. Additionally, we are running out of resources. Thus, transitioning from a linear economy to a circular economy is essential for sustainability. The concept of the circular economy began gaining significant attention in the European Union (EU) around the early 2010s. Since 2011, the European Commission has published several roadmaps outlining the need for a shift towards a circular economy and action plans to promote recycling, reusability, sustainable products, and waste management practices. This concept has gained considerable traction recently, particularly among makerspaces and the maker movement. Makerspaces\u2014community workshops providing access to tools, resources, and knowledge for creation, innovation, and collaboration\u2014are uniquely positioned to support and benefit from the principles of a circular economy. As a consequence, the maker movement and the circular economy benefit and support each other mutually. As environmental concerns have grown, so has awareness and education about sustainable practices. Makerspaces often emphasize education and community learning, making them ideal for spreading knowledge about the circular economy. They align with the circular economy\u2019s focus on resource efficiency. Operating on limited budgets, makerspaces naturally maximize the use of materials and tools, a practical necessity that dovetails with circular principles. As hubs of innovation, makerspaces encourage experimentation and development of new solutions, fostering practices such as upcycling, recycling, and designing products for longevity and disassembly. The European Green Deal\u2019s circular economy action plans financially and reputationally encourage makerspaces, which, in turn, support the circular economy by their nature. Firstly, makerspaces often host repair caf\u00e9s and upcycling workshops, extending product life and reducing waste. Secondly, the maker movement is community-oriented, promoting collaboration and shared knowledge, which are vital for a circular economy\u2019s networks of sharing, repairing, and recycling. Additionally, many makerspaces embrace open-source principles, sharing designs and processes openly, leading to wider adoption of circular practices and innovative solutions replicable by others. Moreover, makerspaces often focus on local production, reducing the need for long supply chains and supporting local economies. This localism aligns with circular economy principles by minimizing transportation emissions and fostering local resource loops. Modular design and the use of sustainable materials are other important subjects the maker movement encourages for circularity. By designing products that can be easily repaired, upgraded, or recycled, makers contribute to the longevity and recyclability of items, core tenets of the circular economy. Thus, it is clear that makerspaces significantly benefit and support the circular economy through their efficient projects and practices. As a summary, if we want to make a system change towards the circular economy by putting the burden on the supplier to take responsible for the longevity of that product and to move to more service-based models rather than product ownership models there were much more likely to overcome this challenge about circularity and moving to a more economy. It is essential encouraging people to gain the confidence and skills that it\u2019s not so hard to try to repair things and to be able to demonstrate the value of the maker space and providing a safe and open and welcome environment to support people to actually repair things rather than simply dispose or recycle them. On the other hand, makerspaces should be circular because circular economy is not to have its must-have. We are using up all our natural resources and we are creating a lot of waste . The role of a makerspace can use products that are already in train and create a second life for those products.","title":"2.2 How Makerspaces Benefit and Support the Circular Economy?"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#221-pop-machina-project","text":"Within the scope of the European Commission\u2019s circular economy action plan, several projects were carried out. The Pop-Machina Project is an EU-funded initiative under the Horizon 2020 program aimed at promoting circular economy practices through the maker movement. The project supports the establishment of makerspaces in seven cities across Europe: Leuven (Belgium), Thessaloniki (Greece), Kaunas (Lithuania), Venlo (Netherlands), Piraeus (Greece), Santander (Spain), and Istanbul (Turkey). These makerspaces are designed to serve as hubs for innovation and community engagement, fostering sustainable practices at the local level. The primary goal of the Pop-Machina Project is to embed circular economy principles into local communities by leveraging the potential of makerspaces. By encouraging the reuse, repair, and recycling of materials, these spaces aim to enhance resource efficiency and reduce waste. The project also places a strong emphasis on education and awareness, offering programs that teach participants about the benefits of a circular economy and how to implement sustainable practices in their daily lives. The Pop-Machina project is significant for this framework for three main reasons. Firstly, its content is directly related to makerspace establishment. Secondly, Fab Lab BCN is one of the institutions that carried out the projects with the consortium (which includes the faculty of MDEF01 and MDEF02 and advisory of this framework). Lastly, one of the makerspaces established within the scope of the project is in Istanbul, where the author of this framework plans to establish another makerspace with the help and support of this framework and all the experiences and information gained during its preparation. Beyond these three reasons, the key aspects of the Pop-Machina project in terms of the circular economy and maker movement are quite inspiring and directive. Not only does the academic content of Pop-Machina help, but also the practical information and methodology of the seven individual and local partners that support the makerspaces in their cities provide makers with ideas on the right approach to consider the circular economy locally. Each city has a local partner carrying out the project; for example, in Istanbul, The Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul is the local partner. Furthermore, these partners share information on their local websites about the main urban problems their cities face, the lacks and opportunities within their cities, potential collaborators, and the potential impact of their projects. Overall, the Pop-Machina Project has the potential to significantly impact local communities by embedding sustainable practices and promoting a circular economy. By leveraging the power of the maker movement, it creates a more resilient and resource-efficient society. This project exemplifies how makerspaces can be harnessed to drive social innovation and sustainability, serving as a model for similar initiatives worldwide.","title":"2.2.1 Pop-Machina Project"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#23-makerspaces-and-waste-management","text":"As an important component of circular economy practices, waste management should be considered in detail by the maker movement. Waste management is the process of handling waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes the collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste, as well as the monitoring and regulation of these processes. Effective waste management is essential for maintaining public health, protecting the environment, and conserving resources. Waste management is often seen as a subject for local or central governments to address, necessitating policies and regulations to manage the processes. However, waste management is fundamentally a social issue. Governments can set rules for industries, but consumers also demand more circular products. Given that waste management is a social issue, makerspaces\u2014as new innovation centers, social clubs, and creative hubs\u2014need to support the concept through projects. By fostering innovation, education, and community engagement, makerspaces can play a crucial role in waste management and the circular economy. They serve as hubs for developing and prototyping new recycling technologies and upcycling projects, turning waste into valuable products. Through workshops and training programs, makerspaces educate communities about sustainable practices and skills in repair, DIY, and sustainable design. By encouraging resource sharing and promoting circular design principles, they minimize waste and extend product lifecycles. Additionally, makerspaces support circular economy principles by hosting repair caf\u00e9s and facilitating material reuse. They contribute to research and development by piloting projects and collecting data to improve sustainability efforts. By raising awareness and influencing policy, makerspaces demonstrate the practical benefits of the circular economy, encouraging wider adoption. Examples like Precious Plastic, Repair Caf\u00e9s, Recycle Beirut, and Makerspace Adelaide highlight the impact of makerspaces in promoting waste reduction and sustainable practices. Effective waste management includes strategies such as recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy conversion. It also involves reducing waste generation through sustainable practices, reusing materials, and encouraging responsible consumption. In big cities, waste management is particularly challenging due to high population density, large volumes of waste, and the need for sophisticated infrastructure to handle different types of waste, including organic, inorganic, hazardous, and electronic waste. Comprehensive waste management systems aim to minimize landfill use, mitigate pollution, and conserve resources, contributing to a cleaner, healthier urban environment. Measuring recycling is an important aspect of waste management. This involves examining the tons of materials, classifying the waste types, and determining whether the materials are recyclable or must be sent to the landfill. Measuring waste management can be straightforward with a set of scales. However, measuring reuse and repairability is challenging and lacks standardized methods. Businesses aiming to adopt a circular economy struggle with this issue. Makerspaces can contribute by measuring their impact on waste prevention. Makerspaces attract diverse individuals, and today, many products are not circular. It is often unclear if everyday objects are repairable or recyclable, and whether repairs can be done by an average person or require a specialist. Manufacturers intentionally limit information to encourage new purchases instead of repairs. Makerspaces, as new social innovation centers, must support repair, recycle, and upcycle concepts through waste management projects, regardless of scale. Makerspaces need a framework to measure contributions to the circular economy. This includes quantifying materials or items repaired or reused, their environmental benefits (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions or water savings), and their economic value. Additionally, they must assess harder-to-measure social benefits, such as community education and instilling values of repairability, reusability, and product longevity in the next generation of designers. In order to understand deeply the support of maker movement to waste management, we need to review some global scale projects that successfully carried out by many makerspaces all around the world;","title":"2.3 Makerspaces and Waste Management"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#231-precious-plastic","text":"The Precious Plastic project is an innovative and influential initiative that aligns closely with the principles of the circular economy and waste management. It was founded by Dutch designer Dave Hakkens in 2013 and has since grown into a global movement. The project aims to tackle plastic waste by providing tools and knowledge to individuals and communities, enabling them to recycle plastic locally and create valuable products from discarded materials. Precious Plastic project is a perfect example of open-source philosophy. All designs, blueprints, and instructional videos for building recycling machines are freely available online. This approach allows anyone, anywhere in the world, to set up their own recycling workspace and start turning plastic waste into new products. The project also provides detailed plans for constructing various DIY recycling machines, including shredder, extrusion machine, injection molder, and compression machine. Moreover, the project has created a global network of makers, recyclers, and innovators who share ideas, solutions, and support that fosters a sense of community and collective effort towards reducing plastic waste. On the other hand, each initiative teach participants about plastic recycling, sustainable practices, and the importance of reducing waste by workshops and educational programs. Consequently, the project not only diverts plastic from landfills but also demonstrates the value and potential of recycled materials by the creation of a wide variety of products, from simple items like bowls and tiles to more complex goods like furniture and art. The Precious Plastic project exemplifies how makerspaces can play a crucial role in promoting circular economy principles and effective waste management. By providing the tools, knowledge, and community support needed to recycle plastic locally, Precious Plastic empowers individuals and communities to take action against plastic pollution and contribute to a more sustainable world.","title":"2.3.1 Precious Plastic"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#232-recycle-beirut","text":"Recycle Beirut is a notable project within the scope of the circular economy and waste management, reflecting how makerspaces can drive social and environmental innovation. Founded in response to Lebanon\u2019s severe waste management crisis, Recycle Beirut exemplifies the powerful impact that grassroots initiatives can have on local communities and ecosystems. This initiative was established in 2015 and combines waste management with social entrepreneurship. It emphasizes proper sorting at the source, educating participants on how to separate their waste into different categories such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal by operating a facility where collected materials are sorted, cleaned, and processed. As a result of the process waste transformed into raw materials that can be reintroduced into the manufacturing cycle. Another aspects of Recycle Beirut is its social mission. The project employs Syrian refugees, providing them with fair wages and safe working conditions. This approach not only addresses environmental issues but also contributes to social equity and economic development within marginalized communities. In addition to this mission, project conducts workshops, campaigns, and outreach programs to raise awareness about the importance of recycling and sustainable waste management. These efforts help build a culture of sustainability and environmental responsibility within the local community. In order to so, they used social media platforms and physical posters to share practical information about recycling. Recycle Beirut is a powerful example of how makerspaces can support and enhance circular economy and waste management efforts.

This project supports waste management, holds significant importance for makerspaces, and profoundly impacts the development of the maker movement by bringing people together and fostering a sense of community within makerspaces. Repair events create opportunities for social interaction, knowledge sharing, and collaborative problem-solving. Participants also learn about repair methods, gain skills, and enhance their technical abilities. This educational aspect aligns with the mission of many makerspaces to provide learning opportunities and skill development. By encouraging communities to repair rather than replace items, makerspaces actively contribute to environmental sustainability. This aligns with the broader goals of many makerspaces to foster innovative solutions to global challenges like circular cities and waste management. Repair Cafe events embody the main principles of the circular economy by keeping products in use longer, thereby reducing the need for new resources and minimizing waste. They also help to change consumer attitudes towards valuing repair over disposal, promoting more sustainable consumption patterns. While the main motivation of the Repair Cafes project\u2014to promote repair over disposal\u2014remains the same, their local implementations can vary. Factors such as community needs, available skills, resources, cultural influences, and local partnerships all play a role in shaping the specific focus and operations of Repair Cafes in different cities. For instance, while bike repair workshops are common and popular in Barcelona, Repair Cafes in Tokyo might prioritize small household items and electronics. Likewise, in economically disadvantaged areas, repair workshops might focus on essential items like kitchen appliances, ensuring that community members can maintain a basic standard of living without needing to purchase new items. This adaptability is one of the strengths of the maker movement and the Repair Cafes project, allowing it to meet the unique needs of diverse communities around the world. The significant win-win situation of the maker movement and waste management can be seen in the environmental impact and the strengthening of the maker movement. By diverting items from landfills, Repair Cafes help reduce the environmental footprint of the community. This practical impact on waste management reinforces the maker movement\u2019s commitment to sustainability. Moreover, repairing items conserves resources, aligning with the movement\u2019s values of efficiency and conservation. On the other hand, Repair Cafes can raise the profile of makerspaces and the maker movement, attracting new members and supporters. They encourage collaboration between makerspaces and other community organizations, building stronger networks for advocacy and action. To sum up, the Repair Cafes project is crucial for makerspaces because it strengthens community ties, utilizes resources efficiently, and promotes sustainability. It also impacts the maker movement by fostering innovation, reducing waste, conserving resources, raising awareness, and building a stronger, more visible network of like-minded individuals and organizations.","title":"2.3.3 Repair Cafes"},{"location":"term4-5-6/03-Master%20Project/#24-power-of-prototyping","text":"Prototyping is the process of creating an early sample or model of a product to test and validate ideas, concepts in very first place. But, the real meaning of prototyping lies in its ability to transform abstract ideas into tangible, testable models, facilitating innovation, improving designs, and accelerating development. Especially in makerspaces, prototyping allows ideas to move from the conceptual stage to a physical or digital form, making abstract concepts understandable and accessible with in the local communities, neighbourhoods and cities. Designers, developers and makers can quickly test their ideas in order to validate them and identify potential issues before investing significant time and resources by prototyping. Communities around makerspaces give feedback which is essential for developing a project by necessary revisions. That is how prototyping go beyond the sample and model of a product or idea. Prototyping is a hands-on approach encourages experimentation and innovation and allows makers to bring their ideas to life quickly and inexpensively. By testing and refining their ideas iteratively, makers are leading to more effective and creative solutions. This trial-and-error process is one of the fundamentals of the maker culture. Through the process, makers learn to troubleshoot and solve problems, which enhances their critical thinking abilities. Additionally, prototyping involves various individual and collaborative skills, such as digital fabrication tools, conventional production and manufacturing techniques, communication and observation for data collection. Learning these skills is a core part of the makerspace experience. On one side, by sharing the knowledge on freely makerspaces become creative hubs that democratize the technology and provides accessibility to the modern manufacturing techniques. On the other side, as prototyping often involves collaboration and brings people together to work on projects, it helps to build a sense of community and fosters teamwork which is another important aspect of the maker movement. Consequently, the inclusive environment of makerspaces and diverse backgrounds of participants empowers the prototyping process. Prototyping is also crucial for startup incubation. Makerspaces provide the tools and community support necessary for entrepreneurs to develop and refine their ideas and products and help to get ready for further development and make necessary adaptations. By fostering new businesses and innovations, makerspaces contribute to local economic development. They often act as incubators for new ideas that can scale up into successful companies. Prototyping in makerspaces also supports circular economy, waste management and resource efficiency. Prototyping tools and skills are often used to repair and modify existing items that supports the circular economy and reducing waste. It also leads to the development of sustainable solutions by enabling rapid testing and iteration. Makers can create more efficient products and processes by prototyping. Overall, no matter if it is a solution to a problem, a way to answer a question or to obtain information, a way to explain a much broader idea or concept prototyping is far beyond a sample or model of a product to test and validate ideas. \u201cLearning by doing\u201d or \u201chands on learning\u201d or \u201cprototyping\u201d manifest the maker culture ethos and has been a driving force behind the development and growth of makerspaces.

The main goal was to democratize these technologies, which were not accessible at the time. Fortunately, the maker movement continued by incorporating traditional practices and techniques -such as woodworking, metalworking, and even sewing- and by building and developing their own communities, the movement successfully became grassroots. The sharing culture in makerspaces\u2014which includes sharing space, tools, knowledge, and experiences\u2014resulted in many interactions within the communities, as most making processes require collaboration. Interactions between makers skilled in digital fabrication and practitioners knowledgeable in traditional techniques created opportunities to build hybrid platforms. As a result of these interactions, some makers and practitioners were able to redesign traditional and artisanal practices using digital fabrication tools. Redesigning artisanal practices with digital fabrication tools in makerspaces is crucial for the future of the maker movement. Firstly, integrating digital fabrication tools into traditional and daily practices makes their usage more meaningful, rather than using them for abstract and superficial projects. Secondly, rediscovering traditional techniques facilitates the exchange of significant amounts of knowledge and tips among participants. Moreover, new coalitions and alliances can be built due to the collaborative nature of the maker movement. Finally, and most importantly, the communities become increasingly diverse by building these coalitions and alliances between practitioners and makers. This diversity in maker communities is essential for grassroots development and for keeping the movement relevant and updated in the real world.

The project aims to bridge the physical and digital worlds, making digital fabrication technologies easier to understand, user-friendly, and applicable to artisanal practices. So far, it has been utilized in the redesign of two traditional practices and one game concept. The team developed a system composed of a physical interface grid, a camera, and a Grasshopper-Rhinoceros based code that functions as the software. The grid serves as a base for pieces with various basic geometric shapes and cubes of different heights, enabling the creation of designs and patterns. Each cube and piece has a Fiducial ID, which is tracked by the camera through the software code in Grasshopper. Fiducial IDs function like quarcodes and are detected by the cameras. The system operates in both the physical and digital worlds. When a user creates a pattern or design on the grid in the real world, the camera tracks and replicates it into a digital version using the Grasshopper code in Rhinoceros. The PTG system has already been integrated into two artisanal practices: screen printing and hydraulic tile making. For screen printing, the desired pattern can be captured and transformed into a format suitable for a vinyl cutter using the software (.stl). The created design is then sent to a 3D printer inappropriate format(.stl) through Cura software for tile making. Accordingly, the vinyl cutter cuts the desired pattern for screen printing, and the 3D printer builds the necessary frame for the tile design. Moreover, the PTG system was also used as a game concept that supports understanding the connections between the digital and physical worlds. Mostly, cubes with various heights placed on the PTG grid were used for the game concept, and the software replicates the design simultaneously in Rhinoceros. The created design can be sent to a 3D printer and built out of filament as it is designed.

After constructing the LDR sensor circuit, I adjusted the resistor to 1K ohms to obtain appropriate readings, allowing for distinct measurements of indoor and outdoor brightness(the other resistor did not give me the precise result-especially for the artificial and natural light difference, so it is essential to know the right resistor to use the sensors efficiantly). The next step was to retrieve data from the LDR sensor. Initially, I attempted to use Bluetooth to connect to my mobile phone, intending to carry the sensor to various locations. However, the process was too complicated, and I was unsuccessful. Eventually, I decided to use Wi-Fi in and around the main IAAC building.

Intermodal shipping refers to moving freight by two or more modes of transportation. By loading cargo into intermodal containers, shipments can move seamlessly between trucks, trains and cargo ships. Intermodal shipments typically fall into one of two categories: international intermodal or domestic intermodal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JcHMhtH6_s First Mile/ Last Mile Problem: Commonly referred to as the \u201cFirst Mile/Last Mile Problem\u201d or \u201cLast Mile Problem\u201d, is a problem that faces public transit, especially in the United States. Just think of the following scenario. Would you walk over a mile to catch the bus to get to work? Or would you rather just drive your automobile to work? Well it might be easier to drive, but also for many, that might not be the case. In many American cities some public transit routes may be inefficient and infrequent. However, people still use these routes for transit needs. But not all live near a transit stop and have to get to the transit stop sometimes from more than half a mile. This is called the first mile/last mile problem. Majority of people are comfortable walking a certain distance to a transit stop. However typically, with increased distance from the transit stop, problems arise when a potential rider is further than a \u201ccomfortable distance\u201d to the necessary fixed-route stop. This is what the problem is. So what are some solutions to this issue? Well rerouting transit stops to cater transit rider needs can be done, providing newer express transit routes is another method, implementing micromobility solutions such as ebikes, escooters to be used by riders to get to transit stops. Microtransit pooling services could be another solution. Land use solutions such as transit oriented development can be a great solution. While each solution comes with some challenges, the first/last mile issue is one that is quite prominent in many American cities. The solutions to fix this issue are present, but will require the due diligence of local governments and transportation agencies to take the lead. In doing so will lead to more people favoring alternative transportation choices away from automobiles. Multimodal Mobility: Multimodal mobility is characterized by a combination of different transportation modes often in a single trip. In order for multimodal transportation to work an extensive use of mobility intelligence and data needs to go into planning an appropriate infrastructure, including public transportation, e-scooter/e-bike stations, shared mobility solutions and more https://otonomo.io/blog/smart-cities-mobility-intelligence/ Burden of a Vehicle Ownership: https://www.vox.com/23753949/cars-cost-ownership-economy-repossession Corporate Mobility: In principle, corporate mobility is a mirror of public mobility in cities and municipalities, with car and bicycle transport, public transport or even ride sharing offers. MaaS: Mobility as a Service? Mobility as a Service (MaaS) integrates various forms of transport and transport-related services into a single, comprehensive, and on-demand mobility service. MaaS offers end-users the added value of accessing mobility through a single application and a single payment channel (instead of multiple ticketing and payment operations). To meet a customer\u2019s request, a MaaS operator hosts a diverse menu of transport options, including (but not limited to) public transport, active modes such as walking and cycling, ride/ car/bike-sharing, taxi, and car rental or lease, or a combination thereof. MaaS aims to be the best value proposition for users, societies, and the environment. \u2028\u2028A successful MaaS service also brings new business models and ways to organise and operate the various transport options, with advantages for transport operators including access to improved user and demand information and new opportunities to serve an unmet need. MaaS aims to provide an alternative to using the private car that may be as convenient, more sustainable, help reduce congestion and constraints in transport capacity and be even cheaper. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMkHtaA472Y https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nqKb1W9-eY Urban Mobility; to create liveable urban spaces/ Urban Travel Patterns * engaging cities and citizens * putting new mobility solutions into practice * reclaiming public space for public use Successful Projects * DHL BOXes and secondary DHL offices * Snapp Iran * Freight Farms Why Shipping Container Farming? * Pabbler Book Your Luggage for Pabbler! https://www.wsj.com/articles/transportation-startup-via-makes-100-million-bet-on-mapping-company-11615336201 Stated Problems; Safety problem in public transportation vehicles because of the changing demographic structure of cities.

Changing the Team to Safe Biking for Seniors \u00b6 My Personal Story for the Process \u00b6 Despite these benefits, there is still potential to increase the number and proportion of older adults cycling. According to a study, 6% of overall urban transportation globally is currently carried out by bicycle, but this percentage could be increased by caglaralkan Final Presentation \u00b6 Kopie von Kopie von Please use this color scheme for the presentation. by Wiszniewski Arts My Urban Shift journey began with extensive research. During the kickoff session in Vienna, I initially worked within a group focused on the transportation of goods. However, I decided to switch to the bike riding group to utilize my industrial design skills, as the previous team was more interested in developing a digital application for CO2 compensation rather than a practical solution. After the kickoff session in Vienna, my new team conducted surveys to validate our hypothesis about the main reasons people avoid bike riding after a certain age. We analyzed the responses in detail and identified two primary causes: loss of balance and urban environment challenges. We decided to develop a product that enhances balance while biking without appearing like additional training wheels. The online meetings, brainstorming sessions, and prototyping were challenging, but ultimately successful. We developed a product concept that combines shopping trolleys with swinging wheels. This design is intended for all bike riders, not just seniors. In Germany and Austria, where active mobility is highly supported, bike riding is a daily activity. Our target group would benefit from using their bikes for grocery shopping. The inclusive design ensures it can be used by everyone. I created a basic model to explain the concept to my teammates. Despite the initial struggles with the concept, it was highly motivating for the team. Yashas and I continued to refine the design and work on the details, while our teammates focused on business and marketing plans. After finalizing the concept and details, Yashas and I built the prototype. With Fiona\u2019s input, we constructed the prototype using wooden sticks and 3D-printed plastic connectors. Although the unstable nature of wood affected the product\u2019s stability, it was sufficient to demonstrate the concept. For further development, the product needs to be built out of metal as initially designed and tested with the target group, particularly in Germany and Austria. Collecting feedback will allow us to review and refine the details, making the product ready for manufacturing. Additionally, some team members can present the prototype to bike retailers and gather their input for further development. Abstract for EasyRide Bags \u00b6 Active mobility is essential for the physical and mental health of humans and is a key component of urban mobility. Although many people enjoy bike riding from childhood, physical limitations can make riding a bike harder and more daunting, especially in urban environments, after the age of 55, according to statistics. EasyRide Bags is a concept that encourages seniors to continue riding bicycles confidently by supporting balance and providing assistance for grocery shopping. By combining swinging wheels with a shopping trolley, EasyRide Bags targets not only seniors but also bike riders of all ages. This design eliminates the uncomfortable feeling seniors may have when seen with additional wheels typically used by children learning to ride. Users can ride their bikes with extra comfort and conveniently detach the it to carry them during supermarket shopping as a trolley. EasyRide Bags is designed to integrate with any bicycle and can be installed by an average person. The product consists of an aluminum structure and two polyester fabric bags attached to it. There are three connectors that keep the aluminum frame and bags attached to the bicycle. Two of them function as rails, and the third one that located under the seat, locks the frame securely to the bike. It can be easily docked, locked, and detached by anyone. Project Credits \u00b6 EasyRide Bags is a project of Urban Shift, developed during the Master in Advanced Architecture (MAA02) at IAAC, the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, by students: Yashas Vishwanath(IAAC), Caglar Alkan(IAAC), Justyna Angermaier(HDM), Olivia Thieme(HDM), Darius Zwecker(WU) faculty: Chiara Farinea, Fiona Demeur & the Urban Shift Project Partners.

Intermodal shipments typically fall into one of two categories: international intermodal or domestic intermodal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JcHMhtH6_s First Mile/ Last Mile Problem: Commonly referred to as the \u201cFirst Mile/Last Mile Problem\u201d or \u201cLast Mile Problem\u201d, is a problem that faces public transit, especially in the United States. Just think of the following scenario. Would you walk over a mile to catch the bus to get to work? Or would you rather just drive your automobile to work? Well it might be easier to drive, but also for many, that might not be the case. In many American cities some public transit routes may be inefficient and infrequent. However, people still use these routes for transit needs. But not all live near a transit stop and have to get to the transit stop sometimes from more than half a mile. This is called the first mile/last mile problem. Majority of people are comfortable walking a certain distance to a transit stop. However typically, with increased distance from the transit stop, problems arise when a potential rider is further than a \u201ccomfortable distance\u201d to the necessary fixed-route stop. This is what the problem is. So what are some solutions to this issue? Well rerouting transit stops to cater transit rider needs can be done, providing newer express transit routes is another method, implementing micromobility solutions such as ebikes, escooters to be used by riders to get to transit stops. Microtransit pooling services could be another solution. Land use solutions such as transit oriented development can be a great solution. While each solution comes with some challenges, the first/last mile issue is one that is quite prominent in many American cities. The solutions to fix this issue are present, but will require the due diligence of local governments and transportation agencies to take the lead. In doing so will lead to more people favoring alternative transportation choices away from automobiles. Multimodal Mobility: Multimodal mobility is characterized by a combination of different transportation modes often in a single trip. In order for multimodal transportation to work an extensive use of mobility intelligence and data needs to go into planning an appropriate infrastructure, including public transportation, e-scooter/e-bike stations, shared mobility solutions and more https://otonomo.io/blog/smart-cities-mobility-intelligence/ Burden of a Vehicle Ownership: https://www.vox.com/23753949/cars-cost-ownership-economy-repossession Corporate Mobility: In principle, corporate mobility is a mirror of public mobility in cities and municipalities, with car and bicycle transport, public transport or even ride sharing offers. MaaS: Mobility as a Service? Mobility as a Service (MaaS) integrates various forms of transport and transport-related services into a single, comprehensive, and on-demand mobility service. MaaS offers end-users the added value of accessing mobility through a single application and a single payment channel (instead of multiple ticketing and payment operations). To meet a customer\u2019s request, a MaaS operator hosts a diverse menu of transport options, including (but not limited to) public transport, active modes such as walking and cycling, ride/ car/bike-sharing, taxi, and car rental or lease, or a combination thereof. MaaS aims to be the best value proposition for users, societies, and the environment. \u2028\u2028A successful MaaS service also brings new business models and ways to organise and operate the various transport options, with advantages for transport operators including access to improved user and demand information and new opportunities to serve an unmet need. MaaS aims to provide an alternative to using the private car that may be as convenient, more sustainable, help reduce congestion and constraints in transport capacity and be even cheaper. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMkHtaA472Y https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nqKb1W9-eY Urban Mobility; to create liveable urban spaces/ Urban Travel Patterns * engaging cities and citizens * putting new mobility solutions into practice * reclaiming public space for public use Successful Projects * DHL BOXes and secondary DHL offices * Snapp Iran * Freight Farms Why Shipping Container Farming? * Pabbler Book Your Luggage for Pabbler! https://www.wsj.com/articles/transportation-startup-via-makes-100-million-bet-on-mapping-company-11615336201 Stated Problems; Safety problem in public transportation vehicles because of the changing demographic structure of cities.

Mobility of goods; The sight of double-parked vehicles loading and unloading goods is common. Solving a problem and make money with that solution to the problem. Next-day deliveries are now a common demand, food deliveries have skyrocketed, and home-working has brought changing needs. On current trends, demand for last-mile deliveries is expected to grow by up to 78% by 2030. 43% of consumers are more likely to choose retailers that offer more sustainable delivery options.9 In our model, if all customers within 1 kilometer of a fulfilment centre were to collect their deliveries on foot, 14% of London\u2019s deliveries would have a zero- emission last mile.

During the kickoff session in Vienna, I initially worked within a group focused on the transportation of goods. However, I decided to switch to the bike riding group to utilize my industrial design skills, as the previous team was more interested in developing a digital application for CO2 compensation rather than a practical solution. After the kickoff session in Vienna, my new team conducted surveys to validate our hypothesis about the main reasons people avoid bike riding after a certain age. We analyzed the responses in detail and identified two primary causes: loss of balance and urban environment challenges. We decided to develop a product that enhances balance while biking without appearing like additional training wheels. The online meetings, brainstorming sessions, and prototyping were challenging, but ultimately successful. We developed a product concept that combines shopping trolleys with swinging wheels. This design is intended for all bike riders, not just seniors. In Germany and Austria, where active mobility is highly supported, bike riding is a daily activity. Our target group would benefit from using their bikes for grocery shopping. The inclusive design ensures it can be used by everyone. I created a basic model to explain the concept to my teammates. Despite the initial struggles with the concept, it was highly motivating for the team. Yashas and I continued to refine the design and work on the details, while our teammates focused on business and marketing plans. After finalizing the concept and details, Yashas and I built the prototype. With Fiona\u2019s input, we constructed the prototype using wooden sticks and 3D-printed plastic connectors. Although the unstable nature of wood affected the product\u2019s stability, it was sufficient to demonstrate the concept. For further development, the product needs to be built out of metal as initially designed and tested with the target group, particularly in Germany and Austria. Collecting feedback will allow us to review and refine the details, making the product ready for manufacturing. Additionally, some team members can present the prototype to bike retailers and gather their input for further development.","title":"Final Presentation"},{"location":"term4-5-6/05-Urban%20Shift/#abstract-for-easyride-bags","text":"Active mobility is essential for the physical and mental health of humans and is a key component of urban mobility. Although many people enjoy bike riding from childhood, physical limitations can make riding a bike harder and more daunting, especially in urban environments, after the age of 55, according to statistics. EasyRide Bags is a concept that encourages seniors to continue riding bicycles confidently by supporting balance and providing assistance for grocery shopping. By combining swinging wheels with a shopping trolley, EasyRide Bags targets not only seniors but also bike riders of all ages. This design eliminates the uncomfortable feeling seniors may have when seen with additional wheels typically used by children learning to ride. Users can ride their bikes with extra comfort and conveniently detach the it to carry them during supermarket shopping as a trolley. EasyRide Bags is designed to integrate with any bicycle and can be installed by an average person. The product consists of an aluminum structure and two polyester fabric bags attached to it. There are three connectors that keep the aluminum frame and bags attached to the bicycle. Two of them function as rails, and the third one that located under the seat, locks the frame securely to the bike. It can be easily docked, locked, and detached by anyone.","title":"Abstract for EasyRide Bags"},{"location":"term4-5-6/05-Urban%20Shift/#project-credits","text":"EasyRide Bags is a project of Urban Shift, developed during the Master in Advanced Architecture (MAA02) at IAAC, the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, by students: Yashas Vishwanath(IAAC), Caglar Alkan(IAAC), Justyna Angermaier(HDM), Olivia Thieme(HDM), Darius Zwecker(WU) faculty: Chiara Farinea, Fiona Demeur & the Urban Shift Project Partners.
