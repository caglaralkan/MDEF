My Alternative Presents \u201cParticipative Design Processes\u201d that include digital fabrication tools and combine them with traditional production techniques encourage makers to be more productive in urban spaces and support them in integrating technology into their workspaces in the age of the post-industrial revolution. In other words, makers gain confidence in using new technologies in their work and seamlessly blend traditional techniques with digital fabrication tools to enhance productivity both individually and within their communities, with the aid of \u201cParticipative Design Processes\u201d. Personally, I am keen on further developing Participative Design Processes by organizing more events, collaborating with different maker spaces, and engaging with other networks. Consulting on participative design processes will lead me down different paths and enable me to gain deeper insights into the design and production processes. Furthermore, documenting and publishing these processes can create more opportunities to establish new connections and networks. In summary, harnessing the potential of collective making, thinking, and designing is crucial in promoting participative design processes.

But, resulted from our experiences we have some practices. Methods of Prototyping and Experimentation in RtD \u00b6 role 1 : The prototype as an experimental component; It\u2019s a very helpful method to develop a product that already exists. In industrial design we can call it redesign . It\u2019s also so common in usability labs for testing different user approaches , it\u2019s not only to test interfaces but also to develop some user friendly forms and attachments. I practiced this method on many design project for instance; a portable X-RAY machine. We tried various designs for interface and most importantly we tried alternatives by dividing the machine into parts to make it easy to use but mostly in order to make it less harmful for the operators, as they are exposed to x-rays a lot. role 4 : The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry; I think this method is more efficient to test new concepts . More or less I also experienced this method to generate a new concept for alcohol meter design. It was a station-kiosk which designed to be used by self decision to inform the driver to warn before start the engine. It was quite helpful to use first digital based prototype to see if the idea works second physical prototypes to test the usability and interactions. role 3 : The prototype as a research archetype; This method would lead some ideas and projects to creative solutions, the examples on the presentation looked really breathtaking.

And during the design process as a way of drifting, serial method looks more interesting to me because I am still not so determined about my final project and I am open for new encounters and discoveries on the path that I want to walk. Communication Methods and Mediums \u00b6 Urban productivity practices Urban farming/ Urban growing/ Maker spaces/ Productive domestic spaces/ Productive community places/ Productive public places(meeting points It isn\u2019t easy to name or specify it, but all the productive practices above needs a kind of knowledge in any case. On the other hand, the amount of knowledge or the way of sharing the necessary info to do productive practices effects the creativity and possible developments in a negative way. So, communication methods and mediums should be determined so carefully in order to have a sustainable productivity and creativity. Stop motion videos, Video journaling, Icons or drawings to make it easy to understand the topics presented, Photographing, and Infographics, would be some ways to document, to show, to explain and give ideas/inspirations/motivations/support the people that I am planning to collaborate. But communication methods and mediums can change according to the locations and number of people that I want to reach. For example; *If I start to do sth at my terrace and collaborate with the people just in my building or just with the MDEF people, a single WhatsApp group and some quick posters and short videos would help to built and support the community. *If I start with a community garden and collaborate with in a neighbourhood, then a Facebook group or an Instagram page would help me to communicate better in terms of communication and support me to reach more people. Additionally, instagram stories and posts will be better to see the progress and the documentation of my project. As the scale of the project change communication mediums and methods need to be considered and redesigned according to take more benefit. First interventions (Experiments, Pilots and first collective intervention): \u00b6 Description and results; \u00b6 Since the industrial revolution most of the people believe that production processes are so difficult and hard to deal with. The approach of most of the manufacturers is to make the consumers completely depended on them. Basically, we can see the example of this approach by the smartphone companies. Apple is almost about to become a monopoly in the smartphone industry and it doesn\u2019t want us to open the phone to see what is inside. We\u2019ve become so lazy and unconfident because black boxes made us to think they are so complicated. We become like machines just to consume, buy anything without thinking if we need them with the help of ads on everywhere. But small communities which try to collapse that bias of producing things is impossible by DIY projects nowadays. And so far from my experiences the main idea is to provide spaces for individuals in those communities. Mostly people want to feel that they have spaces in somewhere, in other words the need to feel belonging somewhere some place, some people without being judged and feel confident. Production Party Interventions: \u00b6 As a first collective intervention I collaborated with Ahmed and Korbi. They have completely different backgrounds; Ahmed is a architect and Korbi is coming from philosophy and international relationship fields. So as an industrial designer it was not easy to design a common project to work on without patronizing my teammates. Our common view point was the desire and need of personal and communal productivity and hacking the supply chain that imposed on us since the industrial revolution. That\u2019s why we decided to name our interventions \u201cproduction party\u201d. Firstly, we used to have different ideas individually about a potential intervention due to test the productivity in the urban spaces. I had the desire to work on something related to urban farming because I already contacted with three different community gardens in Barcelona. Ahmed wanted to work on fabrics and experience sawing and Korbi wanted to built a nomad furniture in order to test the recipe that he found on web. The main struggle about having different ideas and projects resulted from the comfort zone trouble. Each of us felt safer in our own comfort zone. We ended up with the idea of building a vase out of clay that we had designed on Rhinoceros by layers (which can be produced through 3D printer) and to do so, firstly Ahmed and me shared our knowledge of Rhinoceros and 3D modeling with Korbi. It was an efficient warm up exercise for us to get use to each other. None of us had the knowledge or experience on clay as a material. So, it was completely a discovery for three of us. Secondly, we decided to design an intervention by including our MDEF community. We discussed a lot on different ideas. At the end we planned to built two different items out of cardboards with two different instructions and within two groups. (We chose cardboard scraps as a main material, because it\u2019s a material quite accessible and according to me cardboard has incredible potential) It was an efficient method for me to see the difference between two recipes, processes and outcomes. As I had some knowledge on working with cardboard, I preferred to work with printed patterns of a rocking horse, while the second group tried to built a chair by drawing and following the instructions. The first two question appeared in minds while cutting the pieces were the direction and the thickness of the cardboards that needed to built the item. The process of \u201cthe production party intervention\u201d showed us how important is that to have appropriate, good and enough instructions to built something by your own especially when you don\u2019t have enough knowledge and experience on the subject. Additionally, I am quite familiar with this subject from the years that I worked in IKEA. As a retailer of self assembled furnitures, manual designs are very important topic for the company. Manuals, instructions or recipe book, however we called them would be a potential project that we can work on in order to support the concept of some DIY projects. Lastly, our last intervention happened within a workshop which was organized by CdEF -Caixa d\u2019Eines i Feines- a \u201csharing chain\u201d. It was more than a sewing workshop; they are sharing knowledge, machines, tools, materials, space, energy and care with participants-guests. We were able to share a lot in a single evening. As I have some experience and knowledge in sewing, \u0131 tried to encourage my teammates -Ahmed and Korbi- in order to use the sewing machine. It was the first time that Ahmed experienced to saw with machine. We patched some items and we were able to built a fabric shopping bag that we had tried to sew by hand before. We were able to see the difference between the processes when we gain some experience and have better instructions. As a team we also tried to encourage other participants, who came there for the first time and has few knowledge and experience on the topic like us, to involve in the process. It was another efficient experience for me. I figured out personal productivity needs some motivation and support especially when you have little knowledge and experience on the topic. At this point I think it\u2019s really necessary to provide space for individuals to feel confident within the communities like this. Experiencing or trying together by sharing knowledge rather than teaching directly, and encouraging even ends up with fail. And finally, two basic questions appeared in my mind; What discourages you to start your own DIY project? What can motivate you to start your own DIY project?","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20Studio%20I/#vision-and-goals","text":"It\u2019s not easy to be totally aware that what kind of abilities, skills or knowledge we have.

Since the pandemic started we all started to spend more time indoor for ourselves and for our hobbies. I guess its instinctive that most of us at least tried to grow some plants and vegetables.

Since my childhood I like to watch documentaries. The concept Human 2.0 is one of my favorite subject and I like to read, listen and watch about that. I share below some articles and documentaries and TedX Talks about the subject and also a bit of my view point and some of my questions. https://www.kepach.it/film/man-20/ As humans we are quite fragile physically, we have limited capabilities. We couldn\u2019t synthesized most of the amino acids and vitamins even Vitamin C. We need to get them from the nature. But we are creative and since the beginning of the time we are inventing tools to compensate our physical disadvantages. Tools for hunting, foraging, constructing and etc. We also invented some tools to overcome some of our physical disabilities; glasses, contact lenses, laser machines for eye surgery. We invented hi-tech prosthesis for people who lost some body parts, but so long ago we started to produce shoes to protect our feet and continued to run faster. Since twenty years there are so many projects developed on outer skeleton to improve our physical endurance. https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2018/10/01/human-2-0-is-coming-faster-than-you-think-will-you-evolve-with-the-times/?sh=3ad5ea1d4284 And soon it will be possible to use genome sequence and gene therapy (intervention) to get rid of most of the diseases and disabilities that we have related to our genomes. We will be able to to reach the perfect and healthiest and long lasting bodies which will accompany us during our lifetime. Will we be able to modify our eyes with the help of genetic engineering and other biotechnologies to see the outer space? Can we use gene therapy to have stronger, longer muscle legs than Usain Bolt without training? https://medium.com/@publishing_20721/human-2-0-how-far-will-future-humans-go-to-upgrade-their-bodies-b24c9af6375 Among so many, the first question that I have in my mind about genetic interventions is \u201cwhy are we focusing that much on physical perfection and improvement and we are ignoring psychological health and emotional values that we have so much? The genome perfection will be a great way to get rid of so many diseases like muscle loss, Alzheimer, cancer and this will be a great opportunity to spend the resources to develop the humanity rather than curing those diseases. https://www.redalyc.org/journal/5117/511767145020/html/ On the other hand, is that a threat for the genetic diversity of the humankind? I can say that most of the GMOs looks healthy and great but they are far away from being delicious than the locally and traditionally produced ones. As humans I am wondering if we will end up like that? Physically fit and perfect in terms of beauty but boring, monotype and tasteless in terms of social skills and with lack of humor. 2 DIY gadgets and MDEF people","title":"BioAgri"},{"location":"term1/04-Bio%20and%20Agri/#bio-and-agri","text":"Human 2.0 Upgrading the human body, with gadgets, bio-tech prosthesis, surgeries and genome imperfection.

Since twenty years there are so many projects developed on outer skeleton to improve our physical endurance. https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2018/10/01/human-2-0-is-coming-faster-than-you-think-will-you-evolve-with-the-times/?sh=3ad5ea1d4284 And soon it will be possible to use genome sequence and gene therapy (intervention) to get rid of most of the diseases and disabilities that we have related to our genomes. We will be able to to reach the perfect and healthiest and long lasting bodies which will accompany us during our lifetime. Will we be able to modify our eyes with the help of genetic engineering and other biotechnologies to see the outer space? Can we use gene therapy to have stronger, longer muscle legs than Usain Bolt without training? https://medium.com/@publishing_20721/human-2-0-how-far-will-future-humans-go-to-upgrade-their-bodies-b24c9af6375 Among so many, the first question that I have in my mind about genetic interventions is \u201cwhy are we focusing that much on physical perfection and improvement and we are ignoring psychological health and emotional values that we have so much? The genome perfection will be a great way to get rid of so many diseases like muscle loss, Alzheimer, cancer and this will be a great opportunity to spend the resources to develop the humanity rather than curing those diseases. https://www.redalyc.org/journal/5117/511767145020/html/ On the other hand, is that a threat for the genetic diversity of the humankind? I can say that most of the GMOs looks healthy and great but they are far away from being delicious than the locally and traditionally produced ones. As humans I am wondering if we will end up like that? Physically fit and perfect in terms of beauty but boring, monotype and tasteless in terms of social skills and with lack of humor. 2 DIY gadgets and MDEF people","title":"Bio and Agri"},{"location":"term1/05-Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/","text":"Living with Your Own Ideas \u00b6 In the middle of the cities we don\u2019t grow vegetables or we don\u2019t need to collect rain water.

But, since I arrived Barcelona I have the opportunity to spend more time on this concept. I attended Laras project presentation of \u201cAlmacen de Residues\u201d and I found it really interesting in terms of making the scale up by collaborating with restaurants and community gardens. I was not able to attend the paper and soap workshop because I was so sick at that moment, but her works changed my perception to the biomaterial concept. This week we started with so much practices and we worked within the groups. Seher, Ahmed and me we tried to build some bio materials with two different recipes very first day; For the first one, we had 60 grams of coffee scrub, avocado and kiwi peels and oak leafs mixture. I guess because of the volume of coffee scrub 60 grams of food waste was a bit much for the station 4 recipe with the 45 grs. pine resin, 15 ml. alcohol and 5 grs. carnauba wax. The most amazing part of first recipe was to press the mixture with the mold. Probably that reminded me mold making and crafts processes which I worked on a lot.

Material exploration \u00b6 onion peels by Seher Krishna As a group, Seher led us to discover about biomaterials. She has some experiences on that. We deceided to work with onion peels as onion is used widely all around the world and almost every cuisine have it. As the main idea is to work with some wastes, we decided to collaborate with a restaurant called Jerusalem in Poblenou and Micampus community for onion peels and we got coffee grounds from Itnig. After searching the properties of onion peels we decided to focus on the color and light reflection. Firstly, we work on starch base recipe to make the bioplastic. But, we were not happy with the elasticity of the result and even one of the trials was a fail because of using the onion peels without processing it into the blender. The material stuck on the mold. Secondly, we worked on gelatin base recipe. It gave us the elastic property that we need on the third day, but we remarked that the material has to be cut into pieces (at least by cutter/hand) on the third day, otherwise it looses its elasticity because it becomes dry and not let us to cut by hand. Additionally, it looses its flatness. Moreover, we figured out that the one made of starch with intense onion peels became usable as it becomes drier. So, I think to make a data sheet is needed to work on bio materials. On the other hand, we tried to design a lamp made of gelatin base bioplastic and pine resin base bio material for the stand of the lamp. But, we also failed with pine resin recipe. As we talked with Paige, we agree on the idea of over heating the mixture could be the possible cause of fail. My learnings are mostly on technical details as; timing and method for application is an important point to focus on. Some material samples need more time to dry and work on it, but some others need to be cut and shaped immediately in order to get the best result.

But, since I arrived Barcelona I have the opportunity to spend more time on this concept. I attended Laras project presentation of \u201cAlmacen de Residues\u201d and I found it really interesting in terms of making the scale up by collaborating with restaurants and community gardens. I was not able to attend the paper and soap workshop because I was so sick at that moment, but her works changed my perception to the biomaterial concept. This week we started with so much practices and we worked within the groups. Seher, Ahmed and me we tried to build some bio materials with two different recipes very first day; For the first one, we had 60 grams of coffee scrub, avocado and kiwi peels and oak leafs mixture. I guess because of the volume of coffee scrub 60 grams of food waste was a bit much for the station 4 recipe with the 45 grs. pine resin, 15 ml. alcohol and 5 grs. carnauba wax. The most amazing part of first recipe was to press the mixture with the mold. Probably that reminded me mold making and crafts processes which I worked on a lot.

I am confident with the circuits, but coding language is still complicated for me. I guess it will take some time to get familiar and feel comfortable about this language. I searched and found a code to work the piezzo buzzer on ESP32 feather on arduino. I tried to figure out about the whole code, but still I am still far away to be able to design one by my own. circuit by caglaralkan Class Task No:2 \u00b6 As a second task, after the presentation about the 2D-3D modeling softwares, I decided to discover Grasshopper. I am good at using Rhineceros as a 3D modeling application, but mostly I am a bit old fashion. My knowledge based on more technical aspects. If I want to change a small thing on my design after finalizing a 3D model, I need to start to work from the beginning. So, Ahmed helped me to discover Grasshopper and now I do understand what is parametric design is in a better way. As we are planning to work on a modular indoor water-wall, it would be useful for me to design with the help of parametric design tools. discovering grasshopper by caglaralkan Class Task No:3 \u00b6 By using Rhineceros I designed a laptop-stand which stands by the idea of interlocking. As a first step, I checked the materials and their thicknesses. The material thickness is the most important factor for interlocking designs because hacks-notches are keys for the quality of the design. After discussing with Adai about the design and tolerances of the outlines, I modified my design according to fit the pieces on a single cardboard (60X100cm). I cut 2 pieces as a demo in order to test the hacks-notches to get the best results and stability of the stand. During the process I figured out how to use the laser cutter. Beyond the procedures that we have to follow, technical details as; the order of the pieces that we want to cut classified by color coding, and the datas about different materials for various thicknesses and colors hanging on the wall is quite helpful to learn about the details. On the other hand, interface of the software to use the laser cutter is quite easy and clear. Thanks to Adai and Josep again for their support. Interlocking - Cardboard Laptop Stand by caglaralkan Class Task No:4 \u00b6 Building a telegraph like device with LDR and LED with arduino was the fourth task. Even it looked like simple to work with photocell and LED an first glance, it was not possible to go further and built a code for decoding the light signals into Morse code. We started to work with Ahmed on circuit of LDR-photocell and we found the code to work, we thought that we succeed in that but after Victor joined us he remarked that there is a problem with the code because there were a lot of noise in the reading of the amount of the light. As I remember correctly we damaged one Ahmed\u2019s board because we connected the LDR to 5V pin rather than 3-3.3V and it was the main reason of that noise. Then, we continued with the LED circuit. But, we couldn\u2019t achieved with ESP32 and as Wen joined us, we tried to build the circuit with Arduino-UNO. We tried several circuits and codes but we failed. After Victor helped us we checked the items of the circuit with Multimeter and we discovered that one of the cables misbehaved! Additionally, we have learned another important thing about coding; the code is not active on an additional page and it has to be in color to work which we missed. Finally, we put the LDR and LED circuits in a box and tried to build an isolated environment to read the signals from LED when we push the bouton shortly and longer. But, the code that we found to encode and decode the readings and convert those into Morse code and letters had so much lines of problems. So, we were not able to go further in order to build a telegraph with LDR and LED. LDR circuit and Code by caglaralkan Challenge No:1 \u00b6 As a group, after discussing about our common interest and as we want to work on water bricks to store domestic grey water, we decided to work on something related to modularity, interchangeability, personalisation of a product\u2026 We ended up with the idea of building a DIY toolkit which provides designing unique tile decorations and patterns made of those. Firstly, we talked on 3D and 2D options and then we decided to focus on 2D option. For a simple tile decoration we need vinyl designs which needs to be sticked on stencil to transfer the ceramic ink. Instead of providing ready to use patterns, stickers, vinyls we preferred to work on a grid board which provides the user to make their own unique design. Tile-Deco is a concept of grid that made of acrylic and magnets and has geometric pieces which can be located on and stick by magnets to the grid in order to form various tile decorations. Through the design process of the grid board we tried to prevent from shades and reflections which ruins the quality of the photo-digitalisation process of the vinyl. But, as the acrylic thickness and magnet sizes are defined, we couldn\u2019t avoid from that. On the other hand, we covered the acrylic surfaces with a mat vinyl to prevent the reflections. At least we succeeded to get rid of the reflections to enhance the quality of the photo-digitalisation process. But, of course the transfer of the vinyl on the grid board was not easy, we were not satisfied with the first attempt and for the second one magnets destroyed the grid engraved vinyl and fortunately we satisfied with the third vinyl design. Another problem that we faced with was the unsuitability of some geometric pieces which helps to generate the tile decoration design. Some geometric items has only a single magnet on them and this cause a unstable position on the gird. (During the presentation one of the constructive critic was to make the grid board double size in order tom prevent this problem, this could be a perfect solution for the problem) The next step was making the patterns aligned with the photo-digitalisation process. As we took some tile decoration samples photos and we also worked on the various patterns options on 2D softwares. We used Illustrator and Inkscape to generate some patterns. To sum up, the grid board building process was a good experience to use the laser cutter after designing that on Rhinoceros and worked on the technical details to get the best results with the magnets we had to locate on the grid. The final result can be improved by using a thinner and mat acrylic and also by using smaller magnets. This will prevent the shades during the photo-digitalisation process and improve the quality of the edges of the tile decorations. Additionally, building it double size will provide all geometric shapes which helps to build the tile decoration completely stable on the grid. As a development plan; we can continue with 3D options but, we are not sure about how to integrate electronics on our project to develop for the next stages. Tile Deco by caglaralkan Repository link; https://github.com/paresmarc/tiledeco Class Task No:5 \u00b6 Contrary to the previous tasks, rather than modeling some basic thing on Rhinoceros I decided to download a 3D shark model which has has connected pieces in order to test the 3D printers capacity. I downloaded the file from \u201cthingiverse.com\u201d and I discovered that the file has some specifications to help-support the printing process; as if it needs support for being built\u2026 After exported the file in .stl format, I opened that in Ultimaker-Cura and slice it. Surprisingly, 3D printing process with filaments is easier than 3D printing process of clay. When we tried to print some water brick samples made of clay by 3D printing, we had to make 4-5 tests for nozzle distance and speed in order to get the best results. But, I guess as filaments are more stable material, it was fast and easy to get the results. Furthermore, I wanted to print the model by the white filament to use it efficiently during the digital 3D scanning process, but as the white filament spool was heavy, I ended up using the black filament. As I was expecting the black filament effected the process of the digital scanning in a negative way. I was not able to scan the shark with scanner. I tried to scan a asthma-spray pump. Unfortunately, there are some missing surfaces on it. I also tried to scan the bust as it is completely white and less surfaces towards the ground. The result was neither a success, nor a disaster. As long as it hasn\u2019t a complicated organic shape, I prefer to 3D model the object rather than 3D scanning. 3D Shark with joints by caglaralkan Class Task No:6 \u00b6 Networking class with Victor was an introduction for creating network by using the Arduino software and local server. We worked within teams and try to connected to Victors computer by local server and Arduino software interface (especially serial monitor) In order to connect to the Victors computer we need to change some specific parts of the code on Arduino. First of all, we needed to download PunSubClient library and we had to connect to the local network by changing the Wifi name and password on the code. Then, we also had to modify the mqttClientuser (Victor), topicToSub and mqttClientName(our team name). Actually, apart from those, Marielle changed some lines on the code but I couldn\u2019t catch those parts. On the other hand, we were able to modify the message that we sent to Victors computer ( rather than saying \u201chello!\u201d) Coding for Network by caglaralkan Class Task No:7 \u00b6 Beyond blink-breathe-burn, todays class should be named as Coding Language-101. We started the session with \u201cHow hard can it be to turn on a LED?\u201dand I can say that it would be so hard sometimes because of a misbehaved cable or disfunction LED or a wrong type of resistor. I don\u2019t know if its Oscars talent but somehow he was able to explain so many thing about the coding language. At least I was able to catch the steps during the class even some difficulties happened. Oscar tried to move us forward in terms of networking through Arduino from the point that Victor started last week. Surprisingly, this was the best organized hands on learning session of the semester. We went through several steps; just by building a basic LED circuit we started with a \u201cblink\u201d command, and we tried to connected to a network and comment on a LED through an online dashboard. Then, we discovered breathe and burn commands and some important shortcuts instead of repeating the lines in coding; (int I=0;i>5;i++) Also \u201cdefining functions\u201d and \u201cif, else if command lines in the loop\u201d are the other meaningful discoveries for me. Even I am not able to figure it out completely this line.(int num_reps=3 int delay_time=500)I feel more comfortable and ready to work on coding more. Another small but unexpected problem was even the code was correct because of so many people try to connect to the server at the same time, I was not able to connect the server. It took sometime for me to figure that out. I needed to reset the Arduino in order to connect to server and synchronize my Arduino and LED circuit with the others. Coding Language-101 by caglaralkan Class Task No:8 \u00b6 I started my CNC task by modeling a bed-side table on Rhinoceros. As I already knew the thickness of the plywood(15mm), I decided to build an interlocking bed-side table. After modeling the piece, I thought on the modifications on drawing which is necessary for the CNC cutting. As I had decided to use 6mm end-mill, I modified the inner and outer corners of the pieces accordingly. It took more time than I expected. I booked the CNC machine for 11 a.m and arrived at 10 a.m in order to prepare the file for RhinoCam, but it took two and a half hours to start. Beside the preparation of the drawings, there are a lot of parameters that we need to modify for cutting and pocketing. I worked with Josep and he suggested to use \u201cpocketing\u201d function to cut small holes for safety reason to prevent any accident. We also defined the screws as the first cut(work piece). I decided to use 2 different 6mm end-mills for cutting. (6mm ball for pocketing and 6mm flat for cutting) Finishing up the work at Rhino-Cam, we located the 2440X1220mm plywood on the CNC machine. The next step was defining the x-y-z for the machine. For X and Y we used our eye and for Z we used the small button attached to the CNC. The first cut was for the screws. After, applying the screws manually, the pocketing started and we needed to change the end-mill to flat for the final cutting. I made a mistake in the design and had to cut an extra piece. And during that process we made another mistake on the surface and location of the workpiece on Z coordinate. Fortunately, the work piece was over the surface and we did not had a big accident. The following steps was sanding and assembling the pieces. Unexpectedly, sanding the edges and surfaces took so much time. But, at the end I felt satisfy with the result. Building a Bedside Table by CNC cutting by caglaralkan Challenge No:2 \u00b6 We decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we designed during the challenge-1. We mostly wanted to focus on digitalization process in order to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from 2D to 3D as one of the goal that we set before. In other words, it become a playground to discover 3d fabrication which is a bridge between a physical object and digital representative, more than a tile decorating kit. We had some reference projects to help us: MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table, and Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI (Reactable). At the end we had to simplify or goals because of the time limitation. As it is a project connects the physical and digital, it has a lot of details that needs to be solved. This time, we took the base-grid as a playground and decided to let people to play, change, combine the cubes that attached to it and positioned by magnets in order to build their unique design on the grid rather than 2D geometric shapes. We started with the digitalization process. We thought a lot on the process how to convert the physical items to digital representatives. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial id\u201d works like QR codes(with more organic shapes drawings) through cameras. Fiducial IDs can be captured by any cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube that we play-locate on the grid has a unique \u201cFiducial ID\u201don it, and this gives it a parameter on the Z axis to help to form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, as camera detects the cubes on the grid and let the user to move them freely on it, we also needed to program the Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots(6x6) in order to frame design area and make the post-digitalization process easier. Through that process we had lots of problems: we couldn\u2019t solve the problem of the camera detecting the fiducials repeatedly. This process creates a lot of trash on the system and at the end we decided to reset the system as a solution to that problem. Beside the digitalization, we also worked a lot on the physical object. Firstly, we 3D printed the cubes which made of two parts and use 6 magnets in it. But, this method was not appropriate because it took 3 hours for each cube. So we ended up with the idea to build the cubes made of wood and we had to insert the magnets on surfaces. As we had sphere shape magnets, it was a real concern to be able to insert the magnets in the right magnetic directions. We designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet to eliminate that problem and we 3D printed them from raisin. Sphere shape magnets can move in the nest and find their magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we tried to raster the fudicials on cubes with laser cutter but the camera didn\u2019t detect it. Thus, we engraved the outlines and drew by hand at the end. We couldn\u2019t use vinyl because vinyl does not stick on the wood properly. Moreover, we had more trouble to cut the cubes out of the oak block. The block was 33 mm thick and we had to carve the surface 3mm to get 30mm thickness. We did that with the help of Adai and Edu. Through that process we discovered the facing function of the RhinoCam-CNC which provides the carving function with the end-mill has 30mm diameter. The other problem was to use the material efficiently: in order to eliminate material loss in CNC Adai made me to cut the cubes ( as we needed a lot of cubes) with the manual saw which needs a lot of attention and physical job. After engraving the fiducials in laser cutter we cut the cubes with manual saw and we drilled each surfaces (again) manually in order to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we used the CNC machine to build the grid out of plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic in order to build a structure to hold camera above the grid. That structure was designed in order to be located in different positions on the grid to get the right frame and capture the cubes clearly. Mostly we used the grasshopper for digitalization process. But, we also added the arduino in order to use the firefly plug-in and we also added a button to arduino in order to capture the desired design and to build that with the 3D printer. Personal note: As the challenges has to be done by groups, at a certain point projects become complicated and at that point most of the tasks has to be done by different colleagues. So normally, because of the need of using the time efficiently, each one ends up with working on the field that he/she has more experience. This ends with the lack of opportunity to improve some other skills. In short, I want to say that I prefer to have more classes on coding like the one that Oscar gave. During each challenge I was not able to improve my coding skills because as I am a maker I had to work on the machines and 3d modeling. And also we didn\u2019t have time to stay and worked-discover-learn from my classmates. To sum up, I have doubts about the efficiency of challenges. I cannot say that I didn\u2019t discover or learn anything, but I really prefer to have more time and opportunity to have more confidence in coding. But, challenge weeks are so intense and do not let me to discover-learn the coding neither from instructors nor colleagues.

As we took some tile decoration samples photos and we also worked on the various patterns options on 2D softwares. We used Illustrator and Inkscape to generate some patterns. To sum up, the grid board building process was a good experience to use the laser cutter after designing that on Rhinoceros and worked on the technical details to get the best results with the magnets we had to locate on the grid. The final result can be improved by using a thinner and mat acrylic and also by using smaller magnets. This will prevent the shades during the photo-digitalisation process and improve the quality of the edges of the tile decorations. Additionally, building it double size will provide all geometric shapes which helps to build the tile decoration completely stable on the grid. As a development plan; we can continue with 3D options but, we are not sure about how to integrate electronics on our project to develop for the next stages.

I downloaded the file from \u201cthingiverse.com\u201d and I discovered that the file has some specifications to help-support the printing process; as if it needs support for being built\u2026 After exported the file in .stl format, I opened that in Ultimaker-Cura and slice it. Surprisingly, 3D printing process with filaments is easier than 3D printing process of clay. When we tried to print some water brick samples made of clay by 3D printing, we had to make 4-5 tests for nozzle distance and speed in order to get the best results. But, I guess as filaments are more stable material, it was fast and easy to get the results. Furthermore, I wanted to print the model by the white filament to use it efficiently during the digital 3D scanning process, but as the white filament spool was heavy, I ended up using the black filament. As I was expecting the black filament effected the process of the digital scanning in a negative way. I was not able to scan the shark with scanner. I tried to scan a asthma-spray pump. Unfortunately, there are some missing surfaces on it. I also tried to scan the bust as it is completely white and less surfaces towards the ground. The result was neither a success, nor a disaster. As long as it hasn\u2019t a complicated organic shape, I prefer to 3D model the object rather than 3D scanning. 3D Shark with joints by caglaralkan","title":"Class Task No:5"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#class-task-no6","text":"Networking class with Victor was an introduction for creating network by using the Arduino software and local server.

First of all, we needed to download PunSubClient library and we had to connect to the local network by changing the Wifi name and password on the code. Then, we also had to modify the mqttClientuser (Victor), topicToSub and mqttClientName(our team name). Actually, apart from those, Marielle changed some lines on the code but I couldn\u2019t catch those parts.

I don\u2019t know if its Oscars talent but somehow he was able to explain so many thing about the coding language. At least I was able to catch the steps during the class even some difficulties happened. Oscar tried to move us forward in terms of networking through Arduino from the point that Victor started last week. Surprisingly, this was the best organized hands on learning session of the semester. We went through several steps; just by building a basic LED circuit we started with a \u201cblink\u201d command, and we tried to connected to a network and comment on a LED through an online dashboard.

As I already knew the thickness of the plywood(15mm), I decided to build an interlocking bed-side table. After modeling the piece, I thought on the modifications on drawing which is necessary for the CNC cutting. As I had decided to use 6mm end-mill, I modified the inner and outer corners of the pieces accordingly. It took more time than I expected. I booked the CNC machine for 11 a.m and arrived at 10 a.m in order to prepare the file for RhinoCam, but it took two and a half hours to start. Beside the preparation of the drawings, there are a lot of parameters that we need to modify for cutting and pocketing. I worked with Josep and he suggested to use \u201cpocketing\u201d function to cut small holes for safety reason to prevent any accident. We also defined the screws as the first cut(work piece). I decided to use 2 different 6mm end-mills for cutting. (6mm ball for pocketing and 6mm flat for cutting) Finishing up the work at Rhino-Cam, we located the 2440X1220mm plywood on the CNC machine. The next step was defining the x-y-z for the machine. For X and Y we used our eye and for Z we used the small button attached to the CNC. The first cut was for the screws. After, applying the screws manually, the pocketing started and we needed to change the end-mill to flat for the final cutting. I made a mistake in the design and had to cut an extra piece. And during that process we made another mistake on the surface and location of the workpiece on Z coordinate. Fortunately, the work piece was over the surface and we did not had a big accident. The following steps was sanding and assembling the pieces. Unexpectedly, sanding the edges and surfaces took so much time. But, at the end I felt satisfy with the result. Building a Bedside Table by CNC cutting by caglaralkan","title":"Class Task No:8"},{"location":"term2/03-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#challenge-no2","text":"We decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we designed during the challenge-1. We mostly wanted to focus on digitalization process in order to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from 2D to 3D as one of the goal that we set before. In other words, it become a playground to discover 3d fabrication which is a bridge between a physical object and digital representative, more than a tile decorating kit. We had some reference projects to help us: MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table, and Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI (Reactable). At the end we had to simplify or goals because of the time limitation. As it is a project connects the physical and digital, it has a lot of details that needs to be solved. This time, we took the base-grid as a playground and decided to let people to play, change, combine the cubes that attached to it and positioned by magnets in order to build their unique design on the grid rather than 2D geometric shapes. We started with the digitalization process. We thought a lot on the process how to convert the physical items to digital representatives. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial id\u201d works like QR codes(with more organic shapes drawings) through cameras. Fiducial IDs can be captured by any cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube that we play-locate on the grid has a unique \u201cFiducial ID\u201don it, and this gives it a parameter on the Z axis to help to form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, as camera detects the cubes on the grid and let the user to move them freely on it, we also needed to program the Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots(6x6) in order to frame design area and make the post-digitalization process easier. Through that process we had lots of problems: we couldn\u2019t solve the problem of the camera detecting the fiducials repeatedly. This process creates a lot of trash on the system and at the end we decided to reset the system as a solution to that problem. Beside the digitalization, we also worked a lot on the physical object. Firstly, we 3D printed the cubes which made of two parts and use 6 magnets in it. But, this method was not appropriate because it took 3 hours for each cube. So we ended up with the idea to build the cubes made of wood and we had to insert the magnets on surfaces. As we had sphere shape magnets, it was a real concern to be able to insert the magnets in the right magnetic directions. We designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet to eliminate that problem and we 3D printed them from raisin. Sphere shape magnets can move in the nest and find their magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we tried to raster the fudicials on cubes with laser cutter but the camera didn\u2019t detect it. Thus, we engraved the outlines and drew by hand at the end. We couldn\u2019t use vinyl because vinyl does not stick on the wood properly. Moreover, we had more trouble to cut the cubes out of the oak block. The block was 33 mm thick and we had to carve the surface 3mm to get 30mm thickness. We did that with the help of Adai and Edu. Through that process we discovered the facing function of the RhinoCam-CNC which provides the carving function with the end-mill has 30mm diameter. The other problem was to use the material efficiently: in order to eliminate material loss in CNC Adai made me to cut the cubes ( as we needed a lot of cubes) with the manual saw which needs a lot of attention and physical job. After engraving the fiducials in laser cutter we cut the cubes with manual saw and we drilled each surfaces (again) manually in order to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we used the CNC machine to build the grid out of plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic in order to build a structure to hold camera above the grid. That structure was designed in order to be located in different positions on the grid to get the right frame and capture the cubes clearly. Mostly we used the grasshopper for digitalization process. But, we also added the arduino in order to use the firefly plug-in and we also added a button to arduino in order to capture the desired design and to build that with the 3D printer. Personal note: As the challenges has to be done by groups, at a certain point projects become complicated and at that point most of the tasks has to be done by different colleagues. So normally, because of the need of using the time efficiently, each one ends up with working on the field that he/she has more experience. This ends with the lack of opportunity to improve some other skills. In short, I want to say that I prefer to have more classes on coding like the one that Oscar gave. During each challenge I was not able to improve my coding skills because as I am a maker I had to work on the machines and 3d modeling. And also we didn\u2019t have time to stay and worked-discover-learn from my classmates. To sum up, I have doubts about the efficiency of challenges. I cannot say that I didn\u2019t discover or learn anything, but I really prefer to have more time and opportunity to have more confidence in coding. But, challenge weeks are so intense and do not let me to discover-learn the coding neither from instructors nor colleagues.

The world has changed rapidly in the last 40 years. I remember watching our first black and white television without a remote control, but now I can zip around the city on my mono-wheel without even taking a step. However, it\u2019s important to remember that many communities around the world still don\u2019t have access to basic technologies or even clean drinking water, which are essential for survival. The origin of the word \u2018design\u2019 comes from \u2018designare\u2019 in Latin, which means to draw a plan on paper. After architecture, the military, industry, technology, and philosophy, we started to use the word \u2018design\u2019 so often in daily life. I believe that the word \u2018design\u2019 that we talk about in daily life is mostly the outcome of the industrial revolution, used as an advertising agent to convince and motivate people to consume and buy a lot. Additionally, when we start to talk about today\u2019s tools, the first thing that comes to our minds is mostly about technology, which gives us the opportunity to communicate instantly, even with outer space. However, I am thinking about how accessible technology is and what all of these new technologies promise us. For instance; religions promise believers heaven, feudalism promised safety in resource and food cultivation, and capitalism promises social elevation. Any kind of alternatives should have some promises. What could new technologies and the alternative futures promise be? Are we looking forward to the day when we have personal robots that work instead of us, and will we be able to sail among the stars in total peace without worrying about anything? I will try to give some answers to three main questions with the help of todays tools and concept of design approaches. How design can reconfigure systems of extraction? Design has a significant power to challenge and reconfigure systems of extraction by questioning the dominant narratives of what is considered valuable and by considering the social and ecological implications of production and consumption. In the book \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d by Jason Moore, the author explains how the capitalist world system has relied on cheap nature, cheap labor, and cheap energy to fuel the growth of global capitalism. Design can challenge this by questioning the very concept of \u201ccheapness\u201d and reimagining what constitutes value in production and consumption. For example, design can prioritize the use of renewable resources, circular economies, and local sourcing to reduce the extraction of natural resources and the exploitation of labor. Here are some other ways in which design can help reconfigure systems of extraction at first glance: Redesigning products: Designers can help reduce the demand for extractive resources by creating products that are designed for longevity, repairability, and reuse. By designing products that can be easily disassembled and repaired, designers can reduce the need for new resource extraction. Material innovation: Designers can help reduce the environmental impact of resource extraction by developing new materials that are more sustainable and require fewer resources. For example, designers can develop plant-based alternatives to synthetic materials or create new composite materials that are more durable and require fewer resources to produce. Circular economy: Designers can help create a circular economy that minimizes waste and promotes resource efficiency. By designing products and systems that are designed for reuse and recycling, designers can help reduce the need for new resource extraction. Sustainable infrastructure: Designers can help create sustainable infrastructure that reduces the need for extractive resources. For example, designers can create buildings that generate their own energy, reduce water consumption, and minimize waste. Community engagement: Designers can work with local communities to identify their needs and develop solutions that are tailored to their unique circumstances. By engaging with communities that are directly impacted by extractive industries, designers can help create solutions that are more equitable and sustainable. To sum up, design has the potential to play a significant role in reconfiguring systems of extraction by promoting sustainable practices and reducing the environmental impact of resource extraction. Which worlds and futures can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? Today\u2019s tools, such as digital technology and advanced materials, provide designers with unprecedented capabilities to envision and create new worlds. In the book \u201cDesign as Participation\u201d by Kevin Slavin, the author argues that design has the power to shape our social and political realities. Design can be used to imagine and create new social, economic, and political systems that promote social justice, environmental sustainability, and human well-being which is the most important. For example, designers can use virtual and augmented reality to simulate new forms of urban planning or community engagement. They can use advanced materials to create sustainable and resilient infrastructure that responds to the challenges of climate change. I think that any system designed in advance or that grows over time eventually starts to behave like a living organism, searching for alternative ways to sustain itself. For example, the transition from feudalism to capitalism was facilitated by the production of sugar in Madeira. The island\u2019s forests were destroyed to cultivate sugarcane and use it as a fuel source. When the forests were depleted, new solutions were invented, such as cultivating grapes and supplying cheap wood from new markets. As Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore argue in the their book \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d, \u2018Suppose we consider capitalism as an illness; then, it is a disease that consumes your body and profits from selling your remains as fertilizer. The profits earned from selling the fertilizer are then invested in cultivating sugarcane and selling it to visitors who pay to see your grave.\u2019 Here are more examples of the worlds and futures that we can design with today\u2019s tools: Virtual Worlds: With the advancement of technology, we can now design and create virtual worlds that are incredibly realistic and immersive. These worlds can be used for entertainment, education, and even training. Augmented Reality Worlds: Augmented reality (AR) allows us to overlay digital content onto the real world. We can design AR worlds that enhance our surroundings, such as adding information to a museum exhibit or creating an interactive game in a park. 3D Printing Worlds: 3D printing technology has given us the power to create physical objects from digital designs. With 3D printing, we can design and create entire worlds, such as miniature models of cities or landscapes. Space Exploration Worlds: With the help of space exploration tools, we can design and explore worlds beyond our own. We can use telescopes, rovers, and other tools to explore other planets, moons, and even asteroids. Artificial Intelligence Worlds: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to create intelligent agents that can interact with their environment. With AI, we can design and create worlds where these agents can learn and evolve, such as in simulation environments or video games. Human well-being worlds: Design can be used to create a human well-being future with today\u2019s tools by focusing on designing with and for people, rather than simply designing for profit or aesthetics. As Kevin Slavin called this approach \u201cDesign as Participation\u201d, involves actively involving people in the design process and empowering them to shape the products and services that affect their lives. According to Slavin, \u201cDesign as Participation is a way of working that acknowledges and responds to the reality of an interconnected world, where the inputs and outputs of a design are entangled with everything else.\u201d This means that designers must consider the broader social, economic, and environmental impact of their designs, and actively engage with the communities they are designing for. One example of Design as Participation in action is the \u201cTrash Track\u201d project, which was created by the MIT Sensible City Lab. This project used GPS-enabled devices to track the movement of trash through the city, allowing people to better understand the environmental impact of their waste and make more informed decisions about their consumption habits. By involving people in the design process and using technology to create more transparent and participatory systems, Design as Participation has the potential to create a more sustainable, equitable, and human-centered future. In conclusion, with the power of today\u2019s tools, we can design and create a wide range of worlds limited only by our creativity and imagination. Unfortunately, the capacity of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201ctodays tools\u201d that we know and talk about today is not only a result of systems such as capitalism, feudalism, and technology, but is also largely a product of the Industrial Revolution. While the concept of design may have no limit, our personal imaginations and creativity do have limits. Perhaps the concept of a collective-collaborative minds work better in terms of creativity and has more capacity and tools. On the other hand, technology, which is supposed to serve people, causes, supports, and makes every single person on the planet live, act, and behave more individually. In other words, I am doubtful about the role and power of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201c\u201dtodays tools\u201d in terms of alternative ways of living, which are supposed to be better. How can we design the transition towards these worlds and futures? Designing the transition towards more sustainable and just worlds requires a shift from traditional design approaches that focus on products and services to participatory design approaches that engage diverse stakeholders in the design process. In the book \u201cSteps to an Ecology of Mind\u201d by Gregory Bateson, the author argues that the key to creating more sustainable and resilient systems is to focus on the relationships between different elements and actors in the system. Design can facilitate this by engaging diverse stakeholders in the design process, including marginalized communities, workers, and environmental groups. By involving these groups, designers can create more inclusive and equitable systems that respond to the needs and aspirations of all members of society. Moreover, to design a transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a deliberate and strategic approach. Here are some steps that can help facilitate the transition: Set clear goals: To design a transition towards the desired future, we must first establish clear goals and objectives. These goals should be specific, measurable, and actionable, and should reflect the vision for the future. Collaborate: Achieving the desired future will require collaboration across different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals. Collaboration should be fostered through partnerships, co-creation, and open dialogue. Experiment and Prototype: The design of the transition should be iterative, with experiments and prototypes testing and refining ideas before scaling. This approach will allow us to learn from failures and successes, and adjust course as needed. Enable Policy Frameworks: Governments and other policymakers should create the enabling policy frameworks to support the transition. This could include regulations, incentives, and other policy tools to promote sustainable development, social inclusion, and technological innovation. Invest in Innovation: To facilitate the transition, there is a need for investment in innovation and research and development. This could include investments in new technologies, business models, and social innovations that support the desired future. Empower Local Communities: Local communities play a critical role in the transition towards the desired future. Empowering them to participate in the design and implementation of the transition will help to ensure that the transition is inclusive and equitable. As a result, designing the transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a collaborative and inclusive approach, with a focus on experimentation, innovation, and policy frameworks that support the transition. Personal Note; Cash is king, and capital is power, but what was the source of power before that? Physical power? Success? Heritage? There are various sources of power, including physical power for protection and defense, communal power for protection of family, tribe and land, religious power, financial power, resource power, and information-technology power. In all cases, demand and supply also play a key role. What about the power of colonialism? While we criticize the colonial attempts of Europe, many people around the world are trying to obtain a passport from the European Union today. What is the motivation behind that? I believe that, more than the American dream of becoming rich easily, the main motivation and need of human beings is safety. People feel safer within the borders of the European Union than anywhere else. Maybe, first of all it is better to analyze the source of that feeling of safety within the European Union.

Unfortunately, the capacity of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201ctodays tools\u201d that we know and talk about today is not only a result of systems such as capitalism, feudalism, and technology, but is also largely a product of the Industrial Revolution. While the concept of design may have no limit, our personal imaginations and creativity do have limits. Perhaps the concept of a collective-collaborative minds work better in terms of creativity and has more capacity and tools. On the other hand, technology, which is supposed to serve people, causes, supports, and makes every single person on the planet live, act, and behave more individually. In other words, I am doubtful about the role and power of \u201cdesign\u201d and \u201c\u201dtodays tools\u201d in terms of alternative ways of living, which are supposed to be better. How can we design the transition towards these worlds and futures? Designing the transition towards more sustainable and just worlds requires a shift from traditional design approaches that focus on products and services to participatory design approaches that engage diverse stakeholders in the design process. In the book \u201cSteps to an Ecology of Mind\u201d by Gregory Bateson, the author argues that the key to creating more sustainable and resilient systems is to focus on the relationships between different elements and actors in the system. Design can facilitate this by engaging diverse stakeholders in the design process, including marginalized communities, workers, and environmental groups. By involving these groups, designers can create more inclusive and equitable systems that respond to the needs and aspirations of all members of society. Moreover, to design a transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a deliberate and strategic approach. Here are some steps that can help facilitate the transition: Set clear goals: To design a transition towards the desired future, we must first establish clear goals and objectives. These goals should be specific, measurable, and actionable, and should reflect the vision for the future. Collaborate: Achieving the desired future will require collaboration across different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals. Collaboration should be fostered through partnerships, co-creation, and open dialogue. Experiment and Prototype: The design of the transition should be iterative, with experiments and prototypes testing and refining ideas before scaling. This approach will allow us to learn from failures and successes, and adjust course as needed. Enable Policy Frameworks: Governments and other policymakers should create the enabling policy frameworks to support the transition. This could include regulations, incentives, and other policy tools to promote sustainable development, social inclusion, and technological innovation. Invest in Innovation: To facilitate the transition, there is a need for investment in innovation and research and development. This could include investments in new technologies, business models, and social innovations that support the desired future. Empower Local Communities: Local communities play a critical role in the transition towards the desired future. Empowering them to participate in the design and implementation of the transition will help to ensure that the transition is inclusive and equitable. As a result, designing the transition towards the worlds and alternative futures we want requires a collaborative and inclusive approach, with a focus on experimentation, innovation, and policy frameworks that support the transition. Personal Note; Cash is king, and capital is power, but what was the source of power before that? Physical power? Success? Heritage? There are various sources of power, including physical power for protection and defense, communal power for protection of family, tribe and land, religious power, financial power, resource power, and information-technology power. In all cases, demand and supply also play a key role. What about the power of colonialism? While we criticize the colonial attempts of Europe, many people around the world are trying to obtain a passport from the European Union today. What is the motivation behind that? I believe that, more than the American dream of becoming rich easily, the main motivation and need of human beings is safety. People feel safer within the borders of the European Union than anywhere else. Maybe, first of all it is better to analyze the source of that feeling of safety within the European Union.

Specifically, the organization \u2018Caixa d\u2019Eines y Feines\u2019 strives to contribute to and support individuals who are curious about becoming makers, not only by providing them with equipment but also by organizing workshops and facilitating gatherings to encourage sharing of experiences. In my opinion, these gatherings are the first steps in building communities. Firstly, the main idea is \u201cdemocratization and accessibility of production\u201d which can be done by hacking the monopoly on production/manufacturing. At this point it is compulsory to support DIY projects by easily accessible equipment, materials and alternatives making-production methods. Additionally, I made some searches on the concept of transformation of the personal and collective working spaces into places to support the idea of urban productivity. Growing something -urban farming- or recycle/up-cycle materials and resources (especially water) cardboard, wood, metals\u2026 And generating projects to use those resources efficiently. \u201cSocial making - A collective open-ending recipe-manual concept\u201d Secondly, I noticed that there is not a single way of doing something. There are always various possible ways of building anything with different tools and materials. Moreover, every single person does not have access to every material and tool all the time. So a platform can be built to share all of those information about production and material alternatives. We can call this \u201ca play ground\u201d for curious, productive and maker-partaker communities. By the help of this platform makers can share their own recipes, manuals, formulas, equipments, materials, time, labor, power, patience, experiences, clues, styles. As individual makers have the opportunity to come together and share their experiences, the maker communities and the idea of individual productivity will gain power and this would support the alternative futures concept which might grow different than the monopoly of industry and supply chain. We can also call this supporting low tech lifestyle \u2013 which is more sustainable \u2013 or living with less vs producing with less. To sum up, I focused on to dream, support and create alternative urban futures which are more sustainable and individually and communally productive. The main purpose of these alternative futures is to offer alternatives to existing supply chains which provides so much to mediators rather than local producers. Potential questions that I need to ask myself at this point: How meaningful these ideas for others? How to include others to interested and collaborate with you? How to contribute-develop your ideas? Chapter 6: Experimentations and Interventions \u00b6 We started the second term with a general review of our personal/collective projects and the related interventions that we had made during the first semester. During the first session, we tried to find new collaboration opportunities in order to continue our interventions and make them as meaningful as possible. At the end of the first session, I came up with the idea of participating in two main project groups in order to narrow down the wide scope of DIY projects and focus on certain concepts in detail. In the first group, we decided to work on DIY projects related to gray water storage and reuse in domestic spaces. Suddenly, the project group became crowded, and we decided to create sections within the \u2018water group\u2019 and name the potential areas to explore. Based on participants\u2019 areas of interest, each individual continued to work and conduct research in their respective field or fields. The potential areas of interest that concerned my interventions were: Brick Design (Geometry, Structure, Strength, Size) - Slip Casting and Connecting Clay Pieces Leak-free (Working with clay for our purposes) - Identifying Possible Communities to Interact with (Researching and generating ideas on who to involve and how) - and Filtering. Collective Design Space(Water People) \u201cI had previously experienced collecting gray water for a project, and by the third day, I had run out of containers. The main motivation for me to join the water group is to develop a DIY project that provides an easy way to store gray water in domestic spaces. The design of a \u2018water brick\u2019 could be a potential solution for storing gray water, and this concept could evolve into an architectural or constructional item that enables the reuse of gray water for secondary purposes. While this concept can be seen as a final product, there are several steps involved in reaching that ultimate outcome. Below is a table that shows the average daily production of gray water and black water for an individual person.\u201d During my first researches, I figured out that in any cases gray water has to be filtered before stored. Not only for bad smell and preventing the growth of bacterias and microbes in the grey water, but also keep the reservoir clean and long lasting. There are many ways and materials exist to filter different types of water. The most common method is using the rocks-gravel, sand and charcoal materials for filtration. Charcoal is the most common and accessible material to get rid of chemicals and bacterials whereas the sand and rocks-gravel used for bigger particles separation and physical filtration. Rocks-gravel and sand has to be cleaned yearly and charcoal needs to be replaced every two years. I reached these valuable informations through an organization \u201cAqueous Solutions\u201d which works to promote livelihood security, environmental and economic sustainability, and local self-reliance through ecological design and appropriate technologies in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) ( www.aqsolutions.org ). The organization have many experience on the field and they explain the system clearly for different scales. I collaborated with Josephine Bourghardt in order to built a small scale sand-gravel-carhoal filter and test if it works properly. We used the fab-lab and bought same material and succeeded to build and test it. Furthermore, there are other methods and materials available for filtering water for both first and second use. Ceramic filtration is widely used due to its porous structure, which allows water to flow while retaining micro particles. Ultraviolet filtration and reverse osmosis are other popular methods, but they can be quite complex for potential DIY projects. Additionally, Jonathan encouraged us to conduct further research on lipid separation, which is another form of physical filtration, prior to chemical filtration. Lipids can be up-cycled as soap or used to cultivate certain plants. Grey water needs to pass through a physical separator to retain the lipids in specific sections based on density differences. Ramiro, Korbi and I worked on a lipid separator and we tested that. (they continued to work on that separator during the third term) On the other hand, as a second project and intervention group with Marc and Ahmed we agreed on exploring ways to combine digital and physical tools to support DIY projects. As there is a strict boarder between digital worlds and physical representations, it is quite difficult to destroy the bias of how difficult to learn, use and integrate digital tools to generate DIY projects. However they look so complicated and hard to learn and use, digitals tools give us a lot of personalization and customization opportunities to modify any project. As those two terms -personalization and customization- are two important key words for DIY projects, democratization of the digital tools is essential. During the second term with Ahmed and Marc we tried to develop a concept that combine the physical and digital worlds. We took the parametric design as a base and tried to create a base project which provides an environment to make the digital fabrication tools accessible and easy to understand. Collective Intervention no:4 \u00b6 As a group, after discussing about our common interest and as we want to work on water bricks to store domestic grey water, we decided to work on something related to modularity, interchangeability, parametric design, personalization-customization of a product\u2026 We ended up with the idea of building a DIY toolkit which provides designing unique tile decorations and patterns made of those. We also took that opportunity as a first step to connect the digital and physical. Firstly, we talked on 3D and 2D options and then we decided to focus on 2D option. For a simple tile decoration we need vinyl designs which needs to be sticked on stencil frame to transfer the ceramic ink. Instead of providing ready to use patterns, stickers, vinyls we preferred to work on a grid board and some geometric shapes which provides the user to make their own unique design. Tile-Deco is a concept that consists of a grid made of acrylic and magnets. The grid is designed to hold geometric pieces, which can be attached to the grid using magnets, allowing for the creation of various tile decorations. During the design process of the grid board, we aimed to minimize shades and reflections that could negatively impact the quality of the photo-digitalization process of the vinyl. However, due to the defined thickness of the acrylic and sizes of the magnets, it was not possible to completely eliminate these issues. Nevertheless, we covered the acrylic surfaces with a matte vinyl to reduce reflections and enhance the quality of the photo-digitalization process. While the transfer of the vinyl onto the grid board was challenging and required multiple attempts, we finally achieved a satisfactory design with the third vinyl application. Another problem we encountered was the instability of some geometric pieces used to generate the tile decoration design. Some of these pieces had only a single magnet, causing them to be unstable on the grid. During the presentation, a constructive criticism suggested doubling the size of the grid board to address this problem, which could indeed be a perfect solution. The next step involved aligning the patterns with the photo-digitalization process. We took photos of various tile decoration samples and worked on different pattern options using software such as Illustrator and Inkscape. In summary, the process of building the grid board was a valuable experience, involving the use of a laser cutter after designing it on Rhinoceros and working on technical details to achieve the best results with the magnets on the grid. To improve the final result, it would be beneficial to use a thinner and matte acrylic and smaller magnets. This would help prevent shades during the photo-digitalization process and enhance the quality of the tile decoration edges. Furthermore, doubling the size of the grid board would ensure stability for all geometric shapes in building the tile decoration. During our discussions in the MDEF group, we received valuable feedback on our first prototype. Initially, some colleagues found the digitalization process unnecessary and difficult to apply. However, after explaining our main goal of customization, their perception changed. I realized that our project was too focused on a specific end product, such as a tile, which made it challenging to fully explore and experience the connection and transition between the physical and digital worlds and tools. As a development plan, we could explore 3D options, but we are uncertain about how to integrate other digital fabrication tools into our project for future stages and make it more useful beyond being open-source. It is important to note that even if a product or concept is open-source, it does not guarantee easy replication or application. Additionally, it would be beneficial to shift the focus towards the process of connecting the digital and physical worlds and tools, rather than solely on the end product. Reference Projects as Inspiration Collective Intervention no:5 \u00b6 Ahmed, Marc, and I decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we had designed during the previous intervention. Our main focus was on the digitalization process, aiming to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from a 2D to a 3D experience, which was one of our initial goals. In other words, we wanted it to become more than just a tile decorating kit and serve as a playground to explore other digital and 3D fabrication tools as a bridge between physical objects and digital representation. To help us with the project, we looked into reference projects such as MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table and Reactable\u2019s Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI. However, due to time limitations, we had to simplify our goals. Given that this project involves the connection of the physical and digital worlds, there were numerous details that needed to be addressed. This time, we decided to use the base-grid as a playground and allow people to play, change, and combine cubes attached to it using magnets, enabling them to build their unique designs on the grid rather than relying on predefined 2D geometric shapes. We named this project \u201cPixel Cubes\u201d. We started by working on the digitalization process. We put a lot of thought into how to convert the physical items into digital representations. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial ID\u201d that functions similarly to QR codes but with more organic shape drawings. Fiducial IDs can be captured by cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube placed on the grid has a unique fiducial ID, which provides a parameter on the Z-axis (height) to help form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, while the camera detects the cubes on the grid and allows users to move them freely, we also needed to program Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots (6x6) to frame the design area and simplify the post-digitalization process. Throughout this process, we encountered many issues, such as repetitive fiducial detection by the camera, resulting in system clutter. To address this problem, we decided to implement a system reset as a solution. In addition to the digitalization aspect, we put a lot of effort into the physical objects. Initially, we 3D printed the cubes using two parts and included six magnets. However, this method was not suitable as it took three hours for each cube. Eventually, we came up with the idea of using wood to build the cubes and inserted the magnets onto the surfaces. Since we had spherical magnets, it was crucial to insert them in the correct magnetic directions. To solve this problem, we designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet, which eliminated the issue. We 3D printed the nests using resin, allowing the spherical magnets to move and align themselves with the magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we attempted to engrave the fiducials on the cubes using a laser cutter, but the camera did not detect them. As a result, we engraved the outlines and hand-drew the fiducials. Vinyl was not suitable for use on wood as it did not stick properly. Moreover, we encountered difficulties in cutting the cubes out of the oak block. The block was initially 33 mm thick, and we needed to carve it to achieve a 30 mm thickness. With the assistance of Adai and Edu, we managed to carve the surface using the facing function of RhinoCam-CNC, which provided the carving function with an end-mill of 30 mm diameter. Efficient use of the material posed another challenge. To minimize material loss in the CNC process, Adai helped me cut the cubes manually using a saw, which required great attention and physical effort. After engraving the fiducials with the laser cutter, we cut the cubes using a manual saw and manually drilled each surface to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we utilized the CNC machine to construct the grid using plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic to create a structure that held the camera above the grid. This structure was designed to be positioned at different locations on the grid to capture the cubes clearly and frame the design appropriately. We primarily used Grasshopper for the digitalization process. However, we also integrated Arduino to utilize the firefly plug-in and added a button to capture the desired design and build it using the 3D printer. Chapter 7: Updated Vision and Identity \u00b6 Overall, we had the chance to show, test and get feedbacks about Pixel Cubes during Design Dialogues II. Mostly, our guests found the idea quite interesting and helpful as a bridge between physical and digital worlds. As we tried to explain our main goal -which supporting the maker spaces and DIY project by making digital tools accessible and easy to use- our intervention made more sense. Most helpful comments and feedbacks and questions were; - Able to model or 3d print without 3d model skills, - What will be the next step to explore, - Simplify digital and physical processes - Human machine interface Which combine the physical and digital worlds - Focusing on loops-gaps between two worlds and let the digital fabrication processes less complicated - Short cuts; Can visually impaired people design by the help of this concept - Can we simplify and make accessible design processes for everyone - It\u2019s better to recognize the fiducials in the physical world to have the sense According to my fight and my vision my alternative present can be defined like this; \u201cCitizens that interested in making and DIY projects but don\u2019t have experience and courage on digital fabrication to develop advanced projects, now have the opportunity to discover the link between physical and digital worlds\u201d As an updated vision and development plan we need to test our concept within some communities like \u201cCaixa d\u2019Eines y Feines\u201d which supports maker space movements and provides tools and workshops to individuals.","title":"Design Studio II"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#design-studio-ii","text":"Design Studio II","title":"Design Studio II"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#chapter-5-reframing-of-the-project","text":"Overview to lead the path for next stages; Creating Values / Urban productivity practices So far, I have tried to focus on potential collaborations and interventions in order to come together with communities that support maker spaces and urban productivity practices.

Suddenly, the project group became crowded, and we decided to create sections within the \u2018water group\u2019 and name the potential areas to explore. Based on participants\u2019 areas of interest, each individual continued to work and conduct research in their respective field or fields. The potential areas of interest that concerned my interventions were: Brick Design (Geometry, Structure, Strength, Size) - Slip Casting and Connecting Clay Pieces Leak-free (Working with clay for our purposes) - Identifying Possible Communities to Interact with (Researching and generating ideas on who to involve and how) - and Filtering. Collective Design Space(Water People) \u201cI had previously experienced collecting gray water for a project, and by the third day, I had run out of containers. The main motivation for me to join the water group is to develop a DIY project that provides an easy way to store gray water in domestic spaces. The design of a \u2018water brick\u2019 could be a potential solution for storing gray water, and this concept could evolve into an architectural or constructional item that enables the reuse of gray water for secondary purposes. While this concept can be seen as a final product, there are several steps involved in reaching that ultimate outcome. Below is a table that shows the average daily production of gray water and black water for an individual person.\u201d During my first researches, I figured out that in any cases gray water has to be filtered before stored. Not only for bad smell and preventing the growth of bacterias and microbes in the grey water, but also keep the reservoir clean and long lasting. There are many ways and materials exist to filter different types of water. The most common method is using the rocks-gravel, sand and charcoal materials for filtration. Charcoal is the most common and accessible material to get rid of chemicals and bacterials whereas the sand and rocks-gravel used for bigger particles separation and physical filtration. Rocks-gravel and sand has to be cleaned yearly and charcoal needs to be replaced every two years. I reached these valuable informations through an organization \u201cAqueous Solutions\u201d which works to promote livelihood security, environmental and economic sustainability, and local self-reliance through ecological design and appropriate technologies in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) ( www.aqsolutions.org ). The organization have many experience on the field and they explain the system clearly for different scales. I collaborated with Josephine Bourghardt in order to built a small scale sand-gravel-carhoal filter and test if it works properly. We used the fab-lab and bought same material and succeeded to build and test it. Furthermore, there are other methods and materials available for filtering water for both first and second use. Ceramic filtration is widely used due to its porous structure, which allows water to flow while retaining micro particles. Ultraviolet filtration and reverse osmosis are other popular methods, but they can be quite complex for potential DIY projects. Additionally, Jonathan encouraged us to conduct further research on lipid separation, which is another form of physical filtration, prior to chemical filtration. Lipids can be up-cycled as soap or used to cultivate certain plants. Grey water needs to pass through a physical separator to retain the lipids in specific sections based on density differences. Ramiro, Korbi and I worked on a lipid separator and we tested that. (they continued to work on that separator during the third term) On the other hand, as a second project and intervention group with Marc and Ahmed we agreed on exploring ways to combine digital and physical tools to support DIY projects. As there is a strict boarder between digital worlds and physical representations, it is quite difficult to destroy the bias of how difficult to learn, use and integrate digital tools to generate DIY projects. However they look so complicated and hard to learn and use, digitals tools give us a lot of personalization and customization opportunities to modify any project. As those two terms -personalization and customization- are two important key words for DIY projects, democratization of the digital tools is essential. During the second term with Ahmed and Marc we tried to develop a concept that combine the physical and digital worlds. We took the parametric design as a base and tried to create a base project which provides an environment to make the digital fabrication tools accessible and easy to understand.","title":"Chapter 6: Experimentations and Interventions"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#collective-intervention-no4","text":"As a group, after discussing about our common interest and as we want to work on water bricks to store domestic grey water, we decided to work on something related to modularity, interchangeability, parametric design, personalization-customization of a product\u2026 We ended up with the idea of building a DIY toolkit which provides designing unique tile decorations and patterns made of those. We also took that opportunity as a first step to connect the digital and physical. Firstly, we talked on 3D and 2D options and then we decided to focus on 2D option. For a simple tile decoration we need vinyl designs which needs to be sticked on stencil frame to transfer the ceramic ink. Instead of providing ready to use patterns, stickers, vinyls we preferred to work on a grid board and some geometric shapes which provides the user to make their own unique design. Tile-Deco is a concept that consists of a grid made of acrylic and magnets. The grid is designed to hold geometric pieces, which can be attached to the grid using magnets, allowing for the creation of various tile decorations. During the design process of the grid board, we aimed to minimize shades and reflections that could negatively impact the quality of the photo-digitalization process of the vinyl. However, due to the defined thickness of the acrylic and sizes of the magnets, it was not possible to completely eliminate these issues. Nevertheless, we covered the acrylic surfaces with a matte vinyl to reduce reflections and enhance the quality of the photo-digitalization process. While the transfer of the vinyl onto the grid board was challenging and required multiple attempts, we finally achieved a satisfactory design with the third vinyl application. Another problem we encountered was the instability of some geometric pieces used to generate the tile decoration design. Some of these pieces had only a single magnet, causing them to be unstable on the grid. During the presentation, a constructive criticism suggested doubling the size of the grid board to address this problem, which could indeed be a perfect solution. The next step involved aligning the patterns with the photo-digitalization process. We took photos of various tile decoration samples and worked on different pattern options using software such as Illustrator and Inkscape. In summary, the process of building the grid board was a valuable experience, involving the use of a laser cutter after designing it on Rhinoceros and working on technical details to achieve the best results with the magnets on the grid. To improve the final result, it would be beneficial to use a thinner and matte acrylic and smaller magnets. This would help prevent shades during the photo-digitalization process and enhance the quality of the tile decoration edges. Furthermore, doubling the size of the grid board would ensure stability for all geometric shapes in building the tile decoration. During our discussions in the MDEF group, we received valuable feedback on our first prototype. Initially, some colleagues found the digitalization process unnecessary and difficult to apply. However, after explaining our main goal of customization, their perception changed. I realized that our project was too focused on a specific end product, such as a tile, which made it challenging to fully explore and experience the connection and transition between the physical and digital worlds and tools. As a development plan, we could explore 3D options, but we are uncertain about how to integrate other digital fabrication tools into our project for future stages and make it more useful beyond being open-source. It is important to note that even if a product or concept is open-source, it does not guarantee easy replication or application. Additionally, it would be beneficial to shift the focus towards the process of connecting the digital and physical worlds and tools, rather than solely on the end product. Reference Projects as Inspiration","title":"Collective Intervention no:4"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#collective-intervention-no5","text":"Ahmed, Marc, and I decided to develop the tile decorating kit that we had designed during the previous intervention. Our main focus was on the digitalization process, aiming to make it as easy and meaningful as possible. Additionally, we wanted to convert it from a 2D to a 3D experience, which was one of our initial goals. In other words, we wanted it to become more than just a tile decorating kit and serve as a playground to explore other digital and 3D fabrication tools as a bridge between physical objects and digital representation. To help us with the project, we looked into reference projects such as MIT\u2019s interactive shape-shifting table and Reactable\u2019s Reactivision Improvisation with MIDI. However, due to time limitations, we had to simplify our goals. Given that this project involves the connection of the physical and digital worlds, there were numerous details that needed to be addressed. This time, we decided to use the base-grid as a playground and allow people to play, change, and combine cubes attached to it using magnets, enabling them to build their unique designs on the grid rather than relying on predefined 2D geometric shapes. We named this project \u201cPixel Cubes\u201d. We started by working on the digitalization process. We put a lot of thought into how to convert the physical items into digital representations. We discovered a system called \u201cfiducial ID\u201d that functions similarly to QR codes but with more organic shape drawings. Fiducial IDs can be captured by cameras and work with a plug-in program called \u201cfirefly\u201d in Grasshopper-Rhinoceros. Each cube placed on the grid has a unique fiducial ID, which provides a parameter on the Z-axis (height) to help form a unique 3D design. On the other hand, while the camera detects the cubes on the grid and allows users to move them freely, we also needed to program Grasshopper to detect the grid made of slots (6x6) to frame the design area and simplify the post-digitalization process. Throughout this process, we encountered many issues, such as repetitive fiducial detection by the camera, resulting in system clutter. To address this problem, we decided to implement a system reset as a solution. In addition to the digitalization aspect, we put a lot of effort into the physical objects. Initially, we 3D printed the cubes using two parts and included six magnets. However, this method was not suitable as it took three hours for each cube. Eventually, we came up with the idea of using wood to build the cubes and inserted the magnets onto the surfaces. Since we had spherical magnets, it was crucial to insert them in the correct magnetic directions. To solve this problem, we designed a magnet insert (nest) for each magnet, which eliminated the issue. We 3D printed the nests using resin, allowing the spherical magnets to move and align themselves with the magnetic direction easily. Furthermore, we attempted to engrave the fiducials on the cubes using a laser cutter, but the camera did not detect them. As a result, we engraved the outlines and hand-drew the fiducials. Vinyl was not suitable for use on wood as it did not stick properly. Moreover, we encountered difficulties in cutting the cubes out of the oak block. The block was initially 33 mm thick, and we needed to carve it to achieve a 30 mm thickness. With the assistance of Adai and Edu, we managed to carve the surface using the facing function of RhinoCam-CNC, which provided the carving function with an end-mill of 30 mm diameter. Efficient use of the material posed another challenge. To minimize material loss in the CNC process, Adai helped me cut the cubes manually using a saw, which required great attention and physical effort. After engraving the fiducials with the laser cutter, we cut the cubes using a manual saw and manually drilled each surface to insert the magnets with their 3D printed nests. Additionally, we utilized the CNC machine to construct the grid using plywood. We designed and laser cut acrylic to create a structure that held the camera above the grid. This structure was designed to be positioned at different locations on the grid to capture the cubes clearly and frame the design appropriately. We primarily used Grasshopper for the digitalization process. However, we also integrated Arduino to utilize the firefly plug-in and added a button to capture the desired design and build it using the 3D printer.","title":"Collective Intervention no:5"},{"location":"term2/08-Design%20Studio%20II/#chapter-7-updated-vision-and-identity","text":"Overall, we had the chance to show, test and get feedbacks about Pixel Cubes during Design Dialogues II.

The advantages of utilizing a robotic arm compared to other manufacturing methods lie in its flexibility across multiple axes. I can say that it resembles a CNC machine, but certainly it offers additional possibilities like antigravity printing. We tried to explore Grasshopper to comprehend how to generate simulations and experimented with scripts to observe how we could control and modify the parameters. When constructing a path to connect points together, we can determine a curved joint instead of a straight line. This curved path, known as a spline, should be converted to include the corresponding plane for each point.

Through Hydra, we gained the ability to modify existing visuals, write code from scratch, incorporate our own cameras, and even control the visuals using sound inputs. As someone without a coding background, this experience proved immensely beneficial in comprehending how each command affected the visuals and their parameters. It provided valuable insights into the direct relationship between coding commands and the endless possibilities that these tools offer for creative expression. The most entertaining and interesting part was to try to work with the microphones of our computers can be used as an input to get some outcomes. It was quite nice to learn a bit the coding language again. Design by caglaralkan Blender Introduction and Blender Interface with Arduino \u00b6 During the initial session, Victor introduced us to the concept of Blender, its vibrant community, and the diverse range of applications it offers. When selecting a design tool, it is crucial to choose one that not only facilitates learning but also allows for versatile application. I knew that Blender serves as a powerful tool for animation, but I also discovered its other functions on CAD, rendering, and seamlessly connects with numerous devices and interfaces. While there are many tools that promise instant gratification by making things easier, we often tend to avoid investing time in learning such tools due to their lack of intuitiveness. However, this inclination towards simplicity primarily stems from a desire for quick solutions and personal validation. In the second session we started using Blender and learned basic functions in moving models in space and created an array. Victor showed us to use the coding interface of Blender to command the program rather than the basic interface tools. I guess this function is an advantage of Blender than the other CAD and rendering programs, Blender has a lot of ways to interact with it.

Unsurprisingly, I had a lot of problems with Arduino IDE and its libraries and could achieve to finalize the task that we wanted to achieve.

Briefly, our main goal is to support the makers and crafts, and encourage them to use digital fabrication tools. We agreed on using OPENCV shape detector. But, in order to use OPENCV we need PHYTON, ANACONDA and VISUAL STUDIO too. Firstly, we set the anaconda and PYTHON and OPENCV. Then we found a code for shape recognition-detection especially for \u201ccircle\u201d from an image. We tested that through the anaconda and of course code had some problems and we asked from CHATGPT to fix the code. More or less the code works through the image but we needed to calibrate the parameters in order to get more accurate results. During the second day we continued to work on shape detection code. After detecting the circles on the still images we tried to configure the code for squares, rectangle, triangle, semi/quarter circles. We used edge detection and tried to convert them to defined geometric shapes, but we had problems with some undefined ones as lemon shape or croissant shape. So, in order to solve this we worked on polygon contouring but it did not ended up with smooth curves. Then, Pietro joined to support us for using PYTHON libraries. After some discussions, we decided to use QR code detection in OPENCV libraries for assigned geometric shapes as we did with the fiducials on Grasshopper-firefly application model during the Challenge-No2 and we wanted to combine that with Three JS Interactive Voxel Painter project as a grid base. We spent some hours on this approach. Finally, we decided that would take months to finalize the work. We went back to the basic idea to detect the edges of the each geometric shapes on the grid that we designed and decided to eliminate the shades and work on lighting in order to get the best results with this basic and simple method which can be done on OPENCV and PYTHON. During the following two days, we mostly worked on building a new set of shape detecting and tile decorating kit in order to solve the problems of the previous one. Additionally, we built a frame out of hard wood in order to make a hydrolic tile. Hydrolic tile is an old method to decorate the tiles out of color pigments cement and dirt with the help of high pressure. By using our tile deco kit we captured a design and convert that into a STL file and we 3d printed the pattern that we want to paint the tile. We used the CNC machine to cut the frame out of wood. We used the laser cutter to make the tile deco kit out of plywood and acrylic. And we used 3d printer to print the inner frame to decorate the tile with color pigments. We are planing to test the kit next week and get ready for MDEF FEST. Personal note: During this challange we tried to use OpenCV and Python for the first time. Even if we couldn\u2019t get the results that we want it was a nice experience to try these digital tools. And, as I told to Santi and Victor this time we tried to work together rather than dividing the responsibilities and by this way it was more efficient for everyone to have the chance of trying digital tools.

To make our project as accessible as possible, we explored potential open-source interface and infrastructure programs. This aligns with the third challenge of the Prototyping for Design course, which we used to our advantage. Our intention was to address the issues with the grasshopper code for shape/fiducial detection and the interface of the grid. Although we experimented with other shape detection systems, we ultimately decided to continue with grasshopper, as it worked nearly perfectly. As a result, we merged our previous two projects and utilized fiducials to detect each geometric shape, facilitating the generation of designs on the grid-board. Once the design is captured by the camera, the grasshopper code can convert it into different formats, allowing us to export it for vinyl cutting or 3D printing. Consequently, we can create screen prints or hydraulic tiles with the same design. \u201cThe power of first person perspective; designing within the communities\u201d Collective Intervention no:6 As planned at the end of the second term, we proceeded with conducting interventions to test our gadget and design approach. As mentioned earlier, our primary focus is to support maker spaces and encourage makers/craftspeople to integrate digital tools and technologies into their work and workspaces. The gadget we developed during the second term serves as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Initially named Tile-Deco, we later upgraded it to Pixel Cubes, expanding its operating principles from 2D to 3D. In addition to this upgrade, we aimed to enrich the usage of our gadget and held a brainstorming session to explore alternative applications. Considering the importance of a first-person perspective approach in our interventions, practicability, applicability, and suitability for testing were our main considerations. We also took into account the applicability and testability during the brainstorming session, leading us to two ideas for testing our developed gadget. The first idea was to use it to generate designs for screen-printing, and the second idea was to explore the concept of hydraulic tiles. To start, we reached out to Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines to organize a screen-printing workshop. As a warm-up plan, we agreed to collaborate with a two-hour sewing workshop and share the space and participants. We made the necessary preparations and organization, but unfortunately, on the day of the workshop, the IAAC building experienced a flood, preventing us from bringing the vinyl cutter to Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines. Fortunately, we had already cut some stencils in advance. We briefly introduced ourselves and our gadget that is designed to generate unique designs for each participant. However, due to the last-minute issues, we had to explain that we would be using the pre-cut stencils. We then proceeded to explain the process of transferring the vinyl to the frame using transfer tape, providing a demonstration. Since it was not our workshop space, we needed tools such as tweezers, a cutter, scissors, and additional materials like tape. The space and participants were very enthusiastic about helping and supporting the workshop. Due to a heavy and unexpected rainstorm, there were only four participants in the workshop. Nevertheless, they brought their own fabric samples, shirts, and items. We aimed to avoid directing them too much, as we had learned from previous workshops at the same location. The primary ethos of Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines is generally to support makers and share experiences. After transferring the stencil onto the frame, participants selected their preferred colors, and we began the screen-printing process. Introduction of the gadget and explanation of the screen-printing process We demonstrated the process of screen-printing on white sheets that Amanda J. and Samantha Piercy provided from the old clothes and fabric recycling center. Initially, we showcased mono-color printing in our demonstrations, but our participants expressed their interest in mixing colors and creating patterns by applying the same design multiple times on their own. These attempts were highly motivating and encouraging for both us and the participants, confirming that we were in the right place and collaborating with the right community. A Demonstration of Screen-print (transfer of the vinyl, covering the frame, usage of color, application with spatula) During the first session, we applied screen-printing on various surfaces, textures, fabrics, and clothing items such as t-shirts, shirts, and pullovers. This allowed us to explore the versatility of the technique. Additionally, we received a request from the director and participants to repeat the workshop at the second anniversary party of CdFE. Their enthusiasm and creativity made us feel proud of our work. In conclusion, despite encountering some weather-related challenges, our first intervention was highly successful and provided valuable insights for testing our approach and the gadget we developed to support makers and encourage their integration of digital tools into their work. Colorful Results Collective Intervention No:7 As planned, we successfully organized the second screen printing workshop at the CdEF anniversary. This provided us with an opportunity to test the gadget we developed during the second and third terms, which I personally refer to as the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG). The workshop had a high level of participation, with over 30 makers from diverse backgrounds, including architects and finance professionals. Some of our MDEF colleagues also joined to support us. To begin, we provided a brief explanation of the workshop\u2019s main purpose and informed the participants about the equipment and the whole process. Ahmed Yakout took the lead in guiding them through the design generation process using the PTG, while Marc Pares and I carried out the vinyl cutting and stencil transfer for the screen printing process. Explaining the Grid-Board, Geometric Shapes, Vinyl Cutting, Screen-Printing During the design generation process, each participant provided us with different and valuable feedback. Since the grid and geometric shapes have magnets, participants were not entirely free to place items wherever they desired, which caused some initial confusion. However, we explained that the Grasshopper detects shapes with the reference of each square, which has a magnet at its center. This clarification led us to realize the need to redesign the grid interface to be more intuitive and avoid confusion. Surprisingly, some participants expressed a desire to design rectangle-shaped patterns instead of using the square-shaped grid, which challenged our initial assumption. The most significant and useful feedback from the workshop was the need to redesign the interface of the PTG to improve clarity. Participants experienced the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG) to generate their design Furthermore, the interactions we had during the vinyl cutting and stencil transfer process were highly valuable. After participants generated their designs on the PTG, Ahmed captured their patterns with the camera and used the Grasshopper to convert the files into .dxf format, which were then sent to us. We borrowed the vinyl cutter from IAAC and brought it to CdEF to cut the vinyl according to the participants\u2019 designs. We then transferred the stencils onto the frames using transfer tape. Throughout this process, we encouraged participants to assist us to maximize their hands-on experience. Many attendees found this process easier than anticipated and felt confident after gaining some support. Their newfound confidence was evident during the screen printing step, as they eagerly utilized the spatula to apply the ink throughout the frame to their fabric pieces. Screen-Printing Process Moreover, some participants expressed curiosity about the technology behind the PTG and sought to integrate it into their maker space. We provided a brief explanation, and one participant mentioned that their friend had designed the fiducial system we used in Grasshopper to detect shapes and reflect them on the computer screen through RhinoCeros. In conclusion, the second screen printing workshop was highly valuable in terms of interacting with a diverse group of people and receiving feedback to further develop our Phygital Therapy Grid. Personally, it provided me with valuable insights and boosted my confidence and enthusiasm for participatory design processes, which is a new experience for me after fifteen years of industrial design. Outcomes of the Workshop Alternative Explorations Besides the two screen-printing interventions we conducted, we also explored different ideas and applications to maximize the efficiency of the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG). During the interim period between the screen-printing workshops, we decided to collaborate with a ceramic artist named Evan, who works at \u201cStudio 137\u201d in Poblenou. We reached out to him, introduced ourselves, and presented our project, PTG. We visited his workshop at TMDC, and he showed interest in collaborating with us. After a quick brainstorming session, we decided to utilize our gadget to create a set of hydraulic tiles, an ancient tile production technique. During the third challenge of the Digital Prototyping class, we attempted to produce hydraulic tiles using the Phygital Therapy Grid. After capturing the design on the grid, we sent the file to Cura, the software for the 3D printer, and printed the design as a frame to define the tile pattern. We placed the 3D printed frame within the wooden frame we had constructed for hydraulic tile production. 3D-Printed Frame for Hydraulic Tile Decoration The next step involved preparing the color and cement mixtures for decorating the tiles. Normally, powdered color pigments are mixed with white cement, to which water is added. However, we used liquid color pigments typically used for fabric painting and mixed them with gray cement. To achieve the best result and avoid large particles, we sieved the gray cement. We then filled the 3D printed frame with the color pigments and cement mixtures according to the desired decoration. After removing the 3D printed frame, we added more cement by sieving it on top. In the first trial, we added a mixture of sand and cement on top and applied excessive pressure with the hydraulic press. The result was unsuccessful. For the second trial, we decided to add only cement on top, but it resulted in a dry and uneven finish. In the third and final trial, we applied thinner layers of cement, sprayed water on each layer, and applied 2 tons of pressure using the hydraulic press. The end result was quite satisfying. However, as we planned to organize a hydraulic tile workshop for MDEF-FEST, we decided to conduct further research to find the best recipe for hydraulic tiles before attempting another trial with Evan. First Trial Outcomes Once we agreed to organize the hydraulic tile making workshop for MDEF-FEST, we conducted a quick search for the tile mixture recipe. As it is an ancient craftsmanship process, finding a specific recipe proved challenging, and we even consulted Chat-GPT for assistance. Essentially, a single hydraulic tile consists of three layers: the top layer is made of marble powder, white cement, color pigments, and water; the middle layer consists of fine gray cement; and the bottom layer is a mixture of sand and cement. For the second trial, we obtained marble powder and white cement and made several attempts to achieve the best results. We experimented with different ratios for the top and bottom layers to optimize the production process. The main focus of the second trial was to improve the mold, as the imperfect edges of the tiles posed a challenge. Second Trial Outcomes Last Trial with the New Molds and Poster of the Workshop Ultimately, we realized that we are not professional tile makers but rather designers seeking to test the PTG for various applications. Despite not achieving perfect tiles, we decided to continue our journey and explore further possibilities.

Instead of adhering to the consumption culture\u2019s dictates on how to spend our money, I aim to inspire communities and individuals to be more productive and offer them support in various ways. Mariana Quintero coined the term \u201cParticipative Design Process\u201d to describe this approach, and as a designer, I aspire to work with and consult on these processes. One of my goals is to establish stronger connections between craftsmanship and new technologies to foster sustainable practices. Additionally, making new technologies accessible and understandable is another objective of these processes. The 5 W of Scaling and Continuity Why? To form a community, make technology accessible for everyone, encourage people-makers to participate into design processes and digital fabrication tools. Built an alternative way for design and production processes in the age of post industrial revolution era. What? Simplify and integrate digital fabrication tools to participative design processes.

Job/Freelance Business/Startup Non-profit/Cooperations Collective/Network Event/Physical space Academic Research Documentation/Guide Personally, I am keen on further developing Participative Design Processes by organizing more events, collaborating with different maker spaces, and engaging with other networks. Consulting on participative design processes will lead me down different paths and enable me to gain deeper insights into the design and production processes. Furthermore, documenting and publishing these processes can create more opportunities to establish new connections and networks. In summary, harnessing the potential of collective making, thinking, and designing is crucial in promoting participative design processes. Chapter 11: Final Reflection As an industrial designer, I have had the opportunity to work on project briefs that range from strict to flexible over the course of fifteen years in various design fields. Seeking to explore a different design methodology, I enrolled in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF) program. My previous design experiences involved predominantly working alone or in collaboration with other professionals, primarily utilizing computer-based design tools. In some cases, I had the luxury of conducting observations to inform design decisions, but I was often the sole individual responsible for considering the entire usage scenario of a product, system, or service. Understanding and internalizing the core concepts of the MDEF program, such as \u201cDesign Intervention,\u201d \u201cFirst Person Perspective,\u201d \u201cDesigning within the Communities,\u201d and \u201cInterconnectivity,\u201d proved to be a gradual process. It took time to fully grasp the significance and value of these terms. However, by the middle of the second term, I began to appreciate their meaning as I gained more experience interacting with communities. Concepts like \u201cdesign intervention\u201d and \u201cfirst person perspective\u201d started to resonate with me, fostering a growing sense of confidence. With the assistance of the MDEF program\u2019s content, I was able to explore a range of topics and acquire the necessary skills to pursue the path I desired. The combination of lectures and hands-on learning provided a comfortable environment that encouraged exploration. Despite occasional frustrations with the workload, I considered myself fortunate to have the opportunity to discover numerous new technologies, software tools, and production methods. I have previously expressed my thoughts on the MDEF program\u2019s content and the importance of elective courses, particularly given the diverse backgrounds and bachelor degrees of the students in the program. I strongly believe that the inclusion of elective classes would enhance the efficiency of the master\u2019s program for its participants. I would also like to reiterate the significance of \u201cemergent futures\u201d and \u201calternative presents\u201d as key concepts within this master\u2019s program. Rather than focusing solely on speculative future scenarios, I learned to generate alternative present approaches by combining today\u2019s tools with emergent technologies. This perspective became increasingly evident to me throughout the trimester, as I followed the steps, concepts, and ideas in my design journey. Moreover, both individually and collectively, I delved into various topics and engaged with different communities, allowing me to develop a new design perspective. My MDEF journey began with a personal interest in \u201curban productivity practices,\u201d followed by collaborative work on \u201cplayfully production practices\u201d with colleagues, emphasizing low-tech approaches. Subsequently, I had the opportunity to conduct research and implement gray-water collection, filtration, and recycling systems alongside other colleagues. Ultimately, I culminated my journey with a project that integrated digital fabrication tools into craftsmen\u2019s workspaces, empowering maker communities to make efficient use of technology. Along the way, I interacted with community gardens, attended numerous workshops, visited craftsmen\u2019s workshops, made observations in supportive maker spaces and product libraries, organized workshops, and shared my knowledge and experiences with participants. I embraced the role of a designer as a mediator rather than the sole decision-maker, and this shift in attitude brought me greater comfort. In conclusion, my journey in the Master of Design for the Emergent Futures program introduced me to a new design approach. Emphasizing the first-person perspective, designing within communities, and hands-on learning were the key takeaways from this trimester. I have significantly developed my vision and eagerly anticipate applying my newfound skills in various fields, ranging from urban productivity practices to participatory design practices. I firmly believe that I will increasingly contribute to and consult on participatory design practices in the near future.","title":"Design Studio III"},{"location":"term3/07-Design%20Studio%20III/#design-studio-iii","text":"Design Studio III Chapter 8: Final Interventions We began the third term with the aim of further developing the gadget that we had been working on, which combines the physical and digital worlds to support the integration of digital fabrication tools in maker spaces. To make our project as accessible as possible, we explored potential open-source interface and infrastructure programs. This aligns with the third challenge of the Prototyping for Design course, which we used to our advantage. Our intention was to address the issues with the grasshopper code for shape/fiducial detection and the interface of the grid. Although we experimented with other shape detection systems, we ultimately decided to continue with grasshopper, as it worked nearly perfectly. As a result, we merged our previous two projects and utilized fiducials to detect each geometric shape, facilitating the generation of designs on the grid-board. Once the design is captured by the camera, the grasshopper code can convert it into different formats, allowing us to export it for vinyl cutting or 3D printing. Consequently, we can create screen prints or hydraulic tiles with the same design. \u201cThe power of first person perspective; designing within the communities\u201d Collective Intervention no:6 As planned at the end of the second term, we proceeded with conducting interventions to test our gadget and design approach. As mentioned earlier, our primary focus is to support maker spaces and encourage makers/craftspeople to integrate digital tools and technologies into their work and workspaces. The gadget we developed during the second term serves as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Initially named Tile-Deco, we later upgraded it to Pixel Cubes, expanding its operating principles from 2D to 3D. In addition to this upgrade, we aimed to enrich the usage of our gadget and held a brainstorming session to explore alternative applications. Considering the importance of a first-person perspective approach in our interventions, practicability, applicability, and suitability for testing were our main considerations. We also took into account the applicability and testability during the brainstorming session, leading us to two ideas for testing our developed gadget. The first idea was to use it to generate designs for screen-printing, and the second idea was to explore the concept of hydraulic tiles. To start, we reached out to Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines to organize a screen-printing workshop. As a warm-up plan, we agreed to collaborate with a two-hour sewing workshop and share the space and participants. We made the necessary preparations and organization, but unfortunately, on the day of the workshop, the IAAC building experienced a flood, preventing us from bringing the vinyl cutter to Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines. Fortunately, we had already cut some stencils in advance. We briefly introduced ourselves and our gadget that is designed to generate unique designs for each participant. However, due to the last-minute issues, we had to explain that we would be using the pre-cut stencils. We then proceeded to explain the process of transferring the vinyl to the frame using transfer tape, providing a demonstration. Since it was not our workshop space, we needed tools such as tweezers, a cutter, scissors, and additional materials like tape. The space and participants were very enthusiastic about helping and supporting the workshop. Due to a heavy and unexpected rainstorm, there were only four participants in the workshop. Nevertheless, they brought their own fabric samples, shirts, and items. We aimed to avoid directing them too much, as we had learned from previous workshops at the same location. The primary ethos of Caixa D\u2019Eines y Feines is generally to support makers and share experiences. After transferring the stencil onto the frame, participants selected their preferred colors, and we began the screen-printing process. Introduction of the gadget and explanation of the screen-printing process We demonstrated the process of screen-printing on white sheets that Amanda J. and Samantha Piercy provided from the old clothes and fabric recycling center. Initially, we showcased mono-color printing in our demonstrations, but our participants expressed their interest in mixing colors and creating patterns by applying the same design multiple times on their own. These attempts were highly motivating and encouraging for both us and the participants, confirming that we were in the right place and collaborating with the right community. A Demonstration of Screen-print (transfer of the vinyl, covering the frame, usage of color, application with spatula) During the first session, we applied screen-printing on various surfaces, textures, fabrics, and clothing items such as t-shirts, shirts, and pullovers. This allowed us to explore the versatility of the technique. Additionally, we received a request from the director and participants to repeat the workshop at the second anniversary party of CdFE. Their enthusiasm and creativity made us feel proud of our work. In conclusion, despite encountering some weather-related challenges, our first intervention was highly successful and provided valuable insights for testing our approach and the gadget we developed to support makers and encourage their integration of digital tools into their work. Colorful Results Collective Intervention No:7 As planned, we successfully organized the second screen printing workshop at the CdEF anniversary. This provided us with an opportunity to test the gadget we developed during the second and third terms, which I personally refer to as the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG). The workshop had a high level of participation, with over 30 makers from diverse backgrounds, including architects and finance professionals. Some of our MDEF colleagues also joined to support us. To begin, we provided a brief explanation of the workshop\u2019s main purpose and informed the participants about the equipment and the whole process. Ahmed Yakout took the lead in guiding them through the design generation process using the PTG, while Marc Pares and I carried out the vinyl cutting and stencil transfer for the screen printing process. Explaining the Grid-Board, Geometric Shapes, Vinyl Cutting, Screen-Printing During the design generation process, each participant provided us with different and valuable feedback. Since the grid and geometric shapes have magnets, participants were not entirely free to place items wherever they desired, which caused some initial confusion. However, we explained that the Grasshopper detects shapes with the reference of each square, which has a magnet at its center. This clarification led us to realize the need to redesign the grid interface to be more intuitive and avoid confusion. Surprisingly, some participants expressed a desire to design rectangle-shaped patterns instead of using the square-shaped grid, which challenged our initial assumption. The most significant and useful feedback from the workshop was the need to redesign the interface of the PTG to improve clarity. Participants experienced the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG) to generate their design Furthermore, the interactions we had during the vinyl cutting and stencil transfer process were highly valuable. After participants generated their designs on the PTG, Ahmed captured their patterns with the camera and used the Grasshopper to convert the files into .dxf format, which were then sent to us. We borrowed the vinyl cutter from IAAC and brought it to CdEF to cut the vinyl according to the participants\u2019 designs. We then transferred the stencils onto the frames using transfer tape. Throughout this process, we encouraged participants to assist us to maximize their hands-on experience. Many attendees found this process easier than anticipated and felt confident after gaining some support. Their newfound confidence was evident during the screen printing step, as they eagerly utilized the spatula to apply the ink throughout the frame to their fabric pieces. Screen-Printing Process Moreover, some participants expressed curiosity about the technology behind the PTG and sought to integrate it into their maker space. We provided a brief explanation, and one participant mentioned that their friend had designed the fiducial system we used in Grasshopper to detect shapes and reflect them on the computer screen through RhinoCeros. In conclusion, the second screen printing workshop was highly valuable in terms of interacting with a diverse group of people and receiving feedback to further develop our Phygital Therapy Grid. Personally, it provided me with valuable insights and boosted my confidence and enthusiasm for participatory design processes, which is a new experience for me after fifteen years of industrial design. Outcomes of the Workshop Alternative Explorations Besides the two screen-printing interventions we conducted, we also explored different ideas and applications to maximize the efficiency of the Phygital Therapy Grid (PTG). During the interim period between the screen-printing workshops, we decided to collaborate with a ceramic artist named Evan, who works at \u201cStudio 137\u201d in Poblenou. We reached out to him, introduced ourselves, and presented our project, PTG. We visited his workshop at TMDC, and he showed interest in collaborating with us. After a quick brainstorming session, we decided to utilize our gadget to create a set of hydraulic tiles, an ancient tile production technique. During the third challenge of the Digital Prototyping class, we attempted to produce hydraulic tiles using the Phygital Therapy Grid. After capturing the design on the grid, we sent the file to Cura, the software for the 3D printer, and printed the design as a frame to define the tile pattern. We placed the 3D printed frame within the wooden frame we had constructed for hydraulic tile production. 3D-Printed Frame for Hydraulic Tile Decoration The next step involved preparing the color and cement mixtures for decorating the tiles. Normally, powdered color pigments are mixed with white cement, to which water is added. However, we used liquid color pigments typically used for fabric painting and mixed them with gray cement. To achieve the best result and avoid large particles, we sieved the gray cement. We then filled the 3D printed frame with the color pigments and cement mixtures according to the desired decoration. After removing the 3D printed frame, we added more cement by sieving it on top. In the first trial, we added a mixture of sand and cement on top and applied excessive pressure with the hydraulic press. The result was unsuccessful. For the second trial, we decided to add only cement on top, but it resulted in a dry and uneven finish. In the third and final trial, we applied thinner layers of cement, sprayed water on each layer, and applied 2 tons of pressure using the hydraulic press. The end result was quite satisfying. However, as we planned to organize a hydraulic tile workshop for MDEF-FEST, we decided to conduct further research to find the best recipe for hydraulic tiles before attempting another trial with Evan. First Trial Outcomes Once we agreed to organize the hydraulic tile making workshop for MDEF-FEST, we conducted a quick search for the tile mixture recipe. As it is an ancient craftsmanship process, finding a specific recipe proved challenging, and we even consulted Chat-GPT for assistance. Essentially, a single hydraulic tile consists of three layers: the top layer is made of marble powder, white cement, color pigments, and water; the middle layer consists of fine gray cement; and the bottom layer is a mixture of sand and cement. For the second trial, we obtained marble powder and white cement and made several attempts to achieve the best results. We experimented with different ratios for the top and bottom layers to optimize the production process. The main focus of the second trial was to improve the mold, as the imperfect edges of the tiles posed a challenge. Second Trial Outcomes Last Trial with the New Molds and Poster of the Workshop Ultimately, we realized that we are not professional tile makers but rather designers seeking to test the PTG for various applications. Despite not achieving perfect tiles, we decided to continue our journey and explore further possibilities. My Personal Design Space (Term 3) My Personal Design Space (overall) Chapter 9: Final Alternative Present \u201cParticipative Design Processes\u201d that include digital fabrication tools and combine them with traditional production techniques encourage makers to be more productive in urban spaces and support them in integrating technology into their workspaces in the age of the post-industrial revolution. In other words, makers gain confidence in using new technologies in their work and seamlessly blend traditional techniques with digital fabrication tools to enhance productivity both individually and within their communities, with the aid of \u201cParticipative Design Processes\u201d. Chapter 10: Designing yourself out: Strategies for Continuity and Scalability Creativity in personal and collective spaces, support for maker movements, supply chain hacking, democratizing production, and providing alternatives for the post-industrial revolution era regardless of the terminology used, my primary objective is to explore alternative approaches that enhance productivity in urban spaces. Instead of adhering to the consumption culture\u2019s dictates on how to spend our money, I aim to inspire communities and individuals to be more productive and offer them support in various ways. Mariana Quintero coined the term \u201cParticipative Design Process\u201d to describe this approach, and as a designer, I aspire to work with and consult on these processes. One of my goals is to establish stronger connections between craftsmanship and new technologies to foster sustainable practices. Additionally, making new technologies accessible and understandable is another objective of these processes. The 5 W of Scaling and Continuity Why? To form a community, make technology accessible for everyone, encourage people-makers to participate into design processes and digital fabrication tools.

I attended the second class through FaceTime with the help of my friend and I tried to listen the lecture and discussions. But, it was not as efficient as in person. I did my best. During the discussion at class in the first day on the marketing approaches of two different brands which sell a new-born product to support the parents were completely different yet still both took the baby as a source of problems and focus on bringing a solution to that problem.

I also found these three relations interesting; Embodiment relation of mediation human + technology = world Glasses - if a person always wears glasses or contacts then it is always relevant in their perception of the world. Even when you\u2019re driving a car or a skateboard, the whole technology becomes a part of you. The rear of the car becomes like your literal back. Hermeneutic relation human = technology A thermometer, example the weather app, you\u2019re just reading the number but you don\u2019t get the sense of what it is. you need to decode the representation of the world. Digital Twin - tomato and of human\u2019s for the sake of medicine advancement which is useful as you use less resources, less harm and you don\u2019t have to test on animals then. But creating digital twin to predict crime by creating digital twin of people from crime dense neighbourhoods, it\u2019s never going to work. It\u2019s not accurate.

This chart is really interesting for me as an industrial designer. This will help me to think and critic myself when I will work on my next projects. To sum up, the lecture was really nice and helpful. Surprisingly, it was not heavy. Subjects like ethics could be so heavy sometimes. I felt so happy with the approach of this lecture.

I attended the first day of the class and I enjoyed it a lot and I tried to participate and gave some examples about the baby care item and general culture in my own country. How it is seen to have a baby and how much support you can have from your parents and friends during the first years when you have a baby. I attended the second class through FaceTime with the help of my friend and I tried to listen the lecture and discussions. But, it was not as efficient as in person. I did my best. During the discussion at class in the first day on the marketing approaches of two different brands which sell a new-born product to support the parents were completely different yet still both took the baby as a source of problems and focus on bringing a solution to that problem. This approach is totally against the idea of having a child but somehow technologies (in terms of marketing) are taken as services to problems. On the other hand, ChatGPT is the focus of every daily conversation nowadays. Mostly, the main critic is its popularity among the students and especially using it for their homework. Some of my friends are teaching in schools and I discuss this with them a lot. They are complaining about plagiarism. I have doubts about if this is plagiarism or not. According to me it is like using google. There are lots of information on google.
