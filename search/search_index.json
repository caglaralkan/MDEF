My fight is to create some values , I can also call them added values . A loaf of bread, a friendship, a song can be named as an added value. I strongly believe that every value can be created with a system that contains some processes. As the value itself, it\u2019s also important to enjoy through out the process. To create a single value preparation, production and evaluation should be practiced to continue to create more values. During those phases some keywords can help to make the creation process more systematically and sustainable. Motivation, collaboration, workspace, outcomes and inspirations could guide the processes. Additionally, values and concerns should be considered in order to make these processes sustainable. My education and technical background always make me to believe that the processes have to end up with some solid outcomes as a loaf of bread. My other fight is to exercise and accept non-solid endings..","title":"studio"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"What is my fight?

It\u2019s also so common in usability labs for testing different user approaches , it\u2019s not only to test interfaces but also to develop some user friendly forms and attachments. I practiced this method on many design project for instance; a portable X-RAY machine. We tried various designs for interface and most importantly we tried alternatives by dividing the machine into parts to make it easy to use but mostly in order to make it less harmful for the operators, as they are exposed to x-rays a lot. role 4 : The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry; I think this method is more efficient to test new concepts . More or less I also experienced this method to generate a new concept for alcohol meter design. It was a station-kiosk which designed to be used by self decision to inform the driver to warn before start the engine. It was quite helpful to use first digital based prototype to see if the idea works second physical prototypes to test the usability and interactions. role 3 : The prototype as a research archetype; This method would lead some ideas and projects to creative solutions, the examples on the presentation looked really breathtaking.

Since the pandemic started we all started to spend more time indoor for ourselves and for our hobbies. I guess its instinctive that most of us at least tried to grow some plants and vegetables. But still few of us into that activity. Because, even if it\u2019s so hard to produce some edibles at home or in our balconies or terraces. It\u2019s a great feeling to be able to grow something. Which means at a certain point you can survive in extreme conditions. And according to me to survive in cities has become more difficult than in a jungle. As my main fight is to create added values, growing plants or vegetables locally/individually is something so precious. Additionally since years personally I am complaining a lot about the food supply chains in terms of fair trade , mediators, product wastes during transportation and mostly prices\u2026 So supporting the idea of local/indoor/individual production and develop some techniques to support them would sound so excited for me. This idea would be supported in different ways; support who doesn\u2019t have space for growing something, support who finds it unpractical (carrying so many materials and needs to continue for soil, fertilizers, pesticides\u2026and watering), support who finds it inefficient, expensive, time consuming\u2026 On the other hand, it\u2019s really important to provide new job opportunities in the cities. Because cities will become more and more populated and to live in cities in a comfortable and secure way will be possible with co-existing . New job opportunities would be provided redesigning the old jobs; as biker couriers, beach/park sellers, personal coaches\u2026 Basic income work models would be realized by urban farming system-methods and side jobs related to urban farming industry (a new local supply/sharing chain would be built). To sum up (not easy), urban farming has so many areas of opportunity to work on it. It\u2019s possible to combine that with architecture in terms of designing infrastructural elements like Co-Mida project or working on an educational and experimental kits as Instagreen or with complete focus on product design as Domestic Composting . System or service design approaches are also some other fields to work on.","title":"**Design Space and Areas of Opportunity**"},{"location":"term1/04-Design%20Space%20and%20Areas%20of%20Opportunity/#design-space-and-areas-of-opportunity","text":"In their small balconies, on their medium size terraces, in community gardens, on the small garden of a school, sometimes by using small pots, by an old bathtub, by building vertical structures most of the people are so enthusiastic to grow some plants, vegetables and trees.

Since my childhood I like to watch documentaries. The concept Human 2.0 is one of my favorite subject and I like to read, listen and watch about that. I share below some articles and documentaries and TedX Talks about the subject and also a bit of my view point and some of my questions. As humans we are quite fragile physically, we have limited capabilities. We couldn\u2019t synthesized most of the amino acids and vitamins even Vitamin C. We need to get them from the nature. But we are creative and since the beginning of the time we are inventing tools to compensate our physical disadvantages. Tools for hunting, foraging, constructing and etc. We also invented some tools to overcome some of our physical disabilities; glasses, contact lenses, laser machines for eye surgery. We invented hi-tech prosthesis for people who lost some body parts, but so long ago we started to produce shoes to protect our feet and continued to run faster. Since twenty years there are so many projects developed on outer skeleton to improve our physical endurance. And soon it will be possible to use genome sequence and gene therapy (intervention) to get rid of most of the diseases and disabilities that we have related to our genomes. We will be able to to reach the perfect and healthiest and long lasting bodies which will accompany us during our lifetime. Will we be able to modify our eyes with the help of genetic engineering and other biotechnologies to see the outer space? Can we use gene therapy to have stronger, longer muscle legs than Usain Bolt without training?","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/05-Bio%20and%20Agri/#bio-and-agri","text":"Human 2.0 Upgrading the human body, with gadgets, bio-tech prosthesis, surgeries and genome imperfection.
