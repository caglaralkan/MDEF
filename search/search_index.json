My fight is to create some values, I can also call them added values. A loaf of bread, a friendship, a song can be named as an added value. I strongly believe that every value can be created with a system that contains some processes. As the value itself, it\u2019s also important to enjoy through out the process. To create a single value preparation, production and evaluation should be practiced to continue to create more values. During those phases some keywords can help to make the creation process more systematically and sustainable. Motivation, collaboration, workspace, outcomes and inspirations could guide the processes. Additionally, values and concerns should be considered in order to make these proceses sustainable. My education and technical background always make me to believe that the processes have to end up with some solid outcomes as a loaf of bread. My other fight is to exercise and accept non-solid endings..","title":"studio"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"What is my fight?
