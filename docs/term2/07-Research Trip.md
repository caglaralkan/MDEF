# Research Trip


**Research Trip**


We, as humans, copy the nature in order to survive. Trip to El Hierro showed us that a sustainable futures are possible by getting inspired by the nature again. During the trip we visited many places around the island and saw how people can succeed to live with in the nature without any harm. Also it is possible to repair the damage that we caused to the nature.

Here you can find a short video about the island that inspired me a a lot during a week.
