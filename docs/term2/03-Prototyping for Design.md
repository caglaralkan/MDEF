# Prototyping for Design


**Prototyping for Design**

First day class was quite intense in terms of content. I am confident with the circuits, but coding language is still complicated for me. I guess it will take some time to get familiar and feel comfortable about this language. I searched and found a code to work the piezzo buzzer on ESP32 feather on arduino. I tried to figure out about the whole code, but still I am still far away to be able to design one by my own.

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 56.2500%;
 padding-bottom: 0; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px 0 rgba(63,69,81,0.16); margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden;
 border-radius: 8px; will-change: transform;">
  <iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0;margin: 0;"

As a second task, after the presentation about the 2D-3D modeling softwares, I decided to discover Grasshopper. I am good at using Rhineceros as a 3D modeling application, but mostly I am a bit old fashion. My knowledge based on more technical aspects. If I want to change a small thing on my design after finalizing a 3D model, I need to start to work from the beginning. So, Ahmed helped me to discover Grasshopper and now I do understand what is parametric design is in a better way. As we are planning to work on a modular indoor water-wall, it would be useful for me to design with the help of parametric design tools.
