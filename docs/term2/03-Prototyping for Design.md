# Prototyping for Design


**Prototyping for Design**

##Class Task No:1##
First day class was quite intense in terms of content. I am confident with the circuits, but coding language is still complicated for me. I guess it will take some time to get familiar and feel comfortable about this language. I searched and found a code to work the piezzo buzzer on ESP32 feather on arduino. I tried to figure out about the whole code, but still I am still far away to be able to design one by my own.

##Class Task No:2##
As a second task, after the presentation about the 2D-3D modeling softwares, I decided to discover Grasshopper. I am good at using Rhineceros as a 3D modeling application, but mostly I am a bit old fashion. My knowledge based on more technical aspects. If I want to change a small thing on my design after finalizing a 3D model, I need to start to work from the beginning. So, Ahmed helped me to discover Grasshopper and now I do understand what is parametric design is in a better way. As we are planning to work on a modular indoor water-wall, it would be useful for me to design with the help of parametric design tools.

##Class Task No:4##
Building a telegraph like device with LDR and LED with arduino was the fourth task. Even it looked like simple to work with photocell and LED an first glance, it was not possible to go further and built a code for decoding the light signals into Morse code.

We started to work with Ahmed on circuit of LDR-photocell and we found the code to work, we thought that we succeed in that but after Victor joined us he remarked that there is a problem with the code because there were a lot of noise in the reading of the amount of the light. As I remember correctly we damaged one Ahmed's board because we connected the LDR to 5V pin rather than 3-3.3V and it was the main reason of that noise.

Then, we continued with the LED circuit. But, we couldn't achieved with ESP32 and as Wen joined us, we tried to build the circuit with Arduino-UNO. We tried several circuits and codes but we failed. After Victor helped us we checked the items of the circuit with Multimeter and we discovered that one of the cables misbehaved! Additionally, we have learned another important thing about coding; the code is not active on an additional page and it has to be in color to work which we missed.

Finally, we put the LDR and LED circuits in a box and tried to build an isolated environment to read the signals from LED when we push the bouton shortly and longer. But, the code that we found to encode and decode the readings and convert those into Morse code and letters had so much lines of problems. So, we were not able to go further in order to build a telegraph with LDR and LED.
