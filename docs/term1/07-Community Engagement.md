# Community Engagement


##Envisioning My Intervention##
Personally I am interested in democratization of producing, growing, cultivating in urban areas.  In collaboration with two colleagues from MDEF Ahmet and Korbi, we are planning to organize some workshops related with different topics, materials and mediums in order to generate some sharing chains.

##Potential participants##
1. MDEF Colleagues.
2. Connecthort Community.
3. Hort del Clot Community.
4. Public.

##Context##
Urban practices as crafts and makers spaces, small carpenter and metal work workshops, urban farms, horticulture trials, community gardens are the weak signals of the emergent future and they need to be more accessible for the public.

##Current Situation##
There are thousands of videos, gifs, pictures, posts, manuals, patterns and methods on social networks and web. Beside the digital platforms it’s not so common to share the experiences and knowledge in order to encourage the urban productivity and generate the sharing chain concepts. Even maker spaces and community gardens seems quite isolated.

##Engagement and Limits##
Connection between the communities that I am in touch with look quite strong. They are sharing the experiences and knowledge, supporting each other and collaborate if necessary. But in terms of the spaces and places they have some limitations and they don’t look so well known in the public. It could be a decision made because of the conditions; community gardens would have some troubles with renewing the contracts with the municipalities that they have the right to use the place that they own. So, this kind of limitations would make them a bit isolated from the public and keep them just in the neighborhood.

##Theory of Change##
From my perspective urban practices and productive places should be independent from the spaces and they need to be reach public to make an impact among the societies. Additionally, for sustainability and evolving, sharing the methodology and experiences is better than teaching approach .

##Design Challenges and Opportunities##
Extending the limits of maker spaces and moving them to public by pop-up workshops would be a challenge. This would provide so much opportunities for both public and communities. Pop-up workshops can generate synergy and provide the urban practices more reputation. Sharing the knowledge and experiences during workshops would raise awareness on so many subjects that cities are struggling.
