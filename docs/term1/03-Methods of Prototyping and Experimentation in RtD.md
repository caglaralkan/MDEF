# Methods of Prototyping and Experimentation in RtD

role 1: The prototype as an experimental component;                                        It’s a very helpful method to develop a product that already exists. In industrial design we can call it redesign. It’s also so common in usability labs for testing different user approaches , it’s not only to test interfaces but also to develop some user friendly forms and attachments.

I practiced this method on many design project for instance;  a portable X-RAY machine. We tried various designs for interface and most importantly we tried alternatives by dividing the machine into parts to make it easy to use but mostly in order to make it less harmful for the operators, as they are exposed to x-rays a lot.

role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry;
I think this method is more efficient to test new concepts.

More or less I also experienced this method to generate a new concept for alcohol meter design. It was a station-kiosk which designed to be **used** by self decision to inform the driver to warn before start the engine. It was quite helpful to use first digital based prototype to see if the idea works second physical prototypes to test the usability and interactions.

role 3: The prototype as a research archetype;
This method would lead some ideas and projects to creative solutions, the examples on the presentation looked really breathtaking. On the other hand, the main idea has to be taken into consideration carefully.

I prefer to use “The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry” and “The prototype as an experimental component” in order to generate a new concept and to develop it carefully. And during the design process as a way of drifting, serial method looks more interesting to me because I am still not so determined about my final project and I am open for new encounters and discoveries on the path that I want to walk.
