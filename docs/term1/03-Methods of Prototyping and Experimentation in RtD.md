# Methods of Prototyping and Experimentation in RtD

role 1: The prototype as an experimental component;                                        It’s a very helpful method to develop a product that already exists. In industrial design we can call it redesign. It’s also so common in usability labs for testing different user approaches , it’s not only to test interfaces but also to develop some user friendly forms and attachments.I practiced this method on many design project for instance;  a portable X-RAY machine. We tried various designs for interface and most importantly we tried alternatives by dividing the machine into parts to make it easy to use but mostly in order to make it less harmful for the operators, as they are exposed to x-rays a lot.
