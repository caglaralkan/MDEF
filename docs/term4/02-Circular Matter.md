# Circular Matter


**Circular Matter**

**System Mapping**

“Sustainability is the goal you want to achieve, circularity is the way you get there.” Ignasi Cubiña

“Reduce, repair and remanufacture” Walter R.Stahel, 1976

“Antropocyne”

“Social interaction for sustainability” during the presentation there was a moment I heard this sentence and this reminds me the intervention that we tried to achieved during the MDEF01 and participative design process, first person perspective, designing within the communities rather than decision making by authorities or certain group of people.

Moving from scale of individual to building, neighborhoods and cities in order to maintain the sustainability.

**How to map a system?**

**Task 1:**

As the first assignment we worked on a system mapping for “The driver for new demolition and new construction activity in Barcelona”. System mapping based on “Nodes” and “Loops”. “Nodes” can be representatives of the factors, causes, results, problems, solutions. So, we can create “Loops” which as the symbols of systems. That’s why we are calling it System Mapping”

I worked within the group of 5 to make a system mapping for the first assignment. We discussed and defined the “Material Demand” as the main node which is the result of demolition and construction activity in Barcelona that led by the “Housing Demand” which is another node. Housing demand is effected by population growth and tourism. We also agreed on the immigration (especially digital nomads) and refugee crisis (because of war and climate change) factors that effect the population growth.

As material demand increases material transportation also increase and both result with a negative effect on the environmental sustainability. And, less sustainable environment will cause more refugees of climate change. On the other hand, housing demolition and construction as a result of the governmental policy ends up with the gentrification which causes increase in the cost of living which means more housing demand for the low income population.

**Material Story**

**Task 2:**

Presentation / Diagram for a certain material(BRICK) in the Atelier building and search through  EPD(ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION) in order to calculate its CO2 release and effect on the GWP(Global Warming Potential).

First of all we visited the building and defined the brick. Mainly two types of bricks were used to construct the building; Mostly red bricks (columns, back walls and right side wall) and additionally, clay hollow bricks used on the left side wall and painted. So, we made a research on ibu-epd.com to see the EPD and find out the GWP of the two types of bricks. We also considered the GWP of the paint.

Then, we use the 3d model of the building two present the brick walls and columns. We located the 3d model and added our photos that we took. We also remarked that some openings on the back wall were filled up with new (shaped egdes) red bricks. It was obvious that that addings did not applied by a qualified labor as the surface finishes and structure of the added wall. Also, we saw some other fill-ups the holes for old timber beams.

TOTAL GWP FOR BUILDING:

COLUMNS : 1.21 E +04
LEFT INTERIOR WALL : 4.39 E+03
PAINT ON LEFT INTERIOR WALL : 5.7 E+01
INTERIOR BACK WALLS & RIGHT WALL : 1.70 E+04

TOTAL : 3.36 E+04

**Task 3:**

Deconstruction and reuse scenarios of the brick walls and columns of the Atelier building.
