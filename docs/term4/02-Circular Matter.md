# Circular Matter


**Circular Matter**

**System Mapping**

“Sustainability is the goal you want to achieve, circularity is the way you get there.” Ignasi Cubiña

“Reduce, repair and remanufacture” Walter R.Stahel, 1976

“Antropocyne”

“Social interaction for sustainability” during the presentation there was a moment I heard this sentence and this reminds me the intervention that we tried to achieved during the MDEF01 and participative design process, first person perspective, designing within the communities rather than decision making by authorities or certain group of people.

Moving from scale of individual to building, neighborhoods and cities in order to maintain the sustainability.

**How to map a system?**
Task 1:
As the first assignment we worked on a system mapping for “The driver for new demolition and new construction activity in Barcelona”. System mapping based on “Nodes” and “Loops”. “Nodes” can be representatives of the factors, causes, results, problems, solutions. So, we can create “Loops” which as the symbols of systems. That’s why we are calling it System Mapping”

I worked within the group of 5 to make a system mapping for the first assignment. We discussed and defined the “Material Demand” as the main node which is the result of demolition and construction activity in Barcelone that led by the “Housing Demand” which is another node. Housing demand is effected by population growth and tourism. We also agreed on the immigration (especially digital nomads) and refugee crisis (because of war and climate change) factors that effect the population growth.

As material demand increases material transportation also increase and both result with a negative effect on the environmental sustainability. And, less sustainable environment will cause more refugees of climate change. On the other hand, housing demolition and construction as a result of the governmental policy ends up with the gentrification which causes increase in the cost of living which means more housing demand for the low income population.
