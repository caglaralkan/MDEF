4-Vinyl Cut

Milling CNC = SRM-20 Cut  

Fixing the PCB on the milling machine with double sided tape was surprising. But, itâ€™s essential to ensure that the board is firmly placed and securely sticked onto the cutting board. Next, the cutter must be accurately positioned. The cutter is guided to the left front corner, where the x and z zero points can be conveniently established.I can tell that it is more or less same as the CNC machine that we used last year. But, as the scale is really small it is hard to position exactly. To determine the y zero point, the cutter is moved as close to the material as possible. Subsequently, the screw is loosened to precisely position the cutter on the material, then tightened again. This establishes the x/y/z zero point, which can be recorded in the program. The cutter is then slightly raised, and the small CNC mill ready to begin.

Endmills are so fragile, if you accidentally drop it of your hand, it will be broken. It is essential to be careful during the process of installing it to the milling CNC. I asked to Josep how it is possible that it can work to cut the copper while it is so fragile. He told me that while it is turning with a high speed the centrifuge affect makes it solid.

To cut the circuit we used modsproject.org to prepare the file the milling machine software. It basically takes a PNG of the circuit and given a few baseline parameters like mill size, origin location.

Keeps the white cut the blacks!

**How to cut the coppersheet into the circuit?**

For this task is designing our own PCB and solder some electronic components on it. We opted for FR-1 PCBs. They were selected because they offer several advantages: they are non-toxic, possess good mechanical strength, are flame-retardant (a desirable feature, unless you're cooking), and are cost-effective. During the milling process, the top layer of copper is removed from areas not intended for the circuit, essentially focusing on the negative or background sections of the circuit design. To ensure proper connectivity, all designated connection points are encircled by a non-conductive material, creating a barrier between the circuitry and any remaining surface metal on the board. As a result, there may be residual copper in areas not directly involved in the circuit, but these areas remain disconnected from the circuit itself.
