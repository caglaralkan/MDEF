# Design Studio III

**Design Studio III**

**Chapter 8: Final Interventions**

We started the third term with the idea of developing the gadget that we had been working on to combine the physical and digital worlds in order to support the idea of integrating the digital fabrication tools in the maker spaces. We explored possible open source interface and infrastructure programs in order to make our project as accessible as possible. We took the advantage of third challenge of the Prototyping for Design course to do so. We intended to solve the problems of the grasshopper code of the shape/fiducial detection and interface of the grid. Even we tried other shape detection systems, we decided to continue with the grasshopper as it worked almost perfect.

**"The power of first person perspective; designing within the communities"**
